you know , one of the great things about travel and one of the <unk> research is in common with the people who can still remember the ancient days , and they &apos;re still in the wind , they &apos;re still in the wind , they &apos;re still in the wind of bricks &apos; rainfall , they &apos;re hollowed out on the bitter side of the plant .
just knowing that fey &apos;s still been traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of myth , or that in the himalayas , the ecological revelation of neuroscience to propagate itself , which is the idea that the world we live in was not in an absolute sense , but only as a model of reality , as a consequence of the world .
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing children to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we have to come through with the <unk> divide through death , and therefore we shouldn &apos;t surprise to us that we &apos;re all sing dancing , dancing and creating art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique accent of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s happening to be the <unk> <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in the <unk> of the sahara . this is the colleague in the middle of the sahara .
so these people teaches us that there are other other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to keep guidance on the planet .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , can only be linked to hope .
together , the massively cultures of the world &apos;s population contains a web of <unk> and <unk> life , which is the earth , and for the world &apos;s worst as important as biological <unk> , which is as important as the biological <unk> that you see as a refugee .
so you can think of this cultural <unk> as an ecstatic period . <unk> , as the <unk> of all thoughts , and dreams , relentless ideas from human imagination are being defined by the beginnings of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of what we are capable of , and what we can do as an amazing <unk> species .
and as the biosphere became a lot darker , this was happening with the <unk> -- just with a greater speed .
now , not a biologist , for example , would like 50 percent or more of all species about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true . and yet , this -- the aromatic <unk> on the field of biological diversity -- not equivalent to what we consider to be known as cultural diversity in the field of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of the languages .
when each of them in that room was born , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet .
now language is not just the totality of the <unk> , or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it is a mash-up that manages the soul of a certain cultural access to the physical world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of the spirit , a tipping point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from the 6,000 of that 6,000 , as we sit here in monterey , right half the way we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , right half the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore , because they &apos;re not getting done , they &apos;re actually dead already dead .
what might be more lonely than the silence of silence to be one of the best of your people who speak to your language , which is not a way to expect the wisdom of our ancestors , or to expect the hope children of our ancestors ?
and yet , this horrible paradigm happens somewhere on earth , about two weeks because of all two weeks , because of all two weeks , an old person dies of an old human language with the grave .
and i know some of them says , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t it be a better place , if we &apos;re all going to speak only one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say that language is yoruba . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then they would suddenly realize what it would be like if they could not speak of their own language .
so today , i &apos;m going to take you through a journey through the <unk> , which is a brief journey through the campaign to try to make them understand what is actually lost .
now there are some of us who are kind of forgotten that when i say , &quot; different ways of his being , &quot; i mean , &quot; different ways of his presence . &quot;
take this baby in the northwest quadrant in the northwest of the amazon basin in the northwest of the amazon , the people of <unk> , believe that they were <unk> the <unk> from the east coast of sacred snakes <unk> .
this is a population , which is not cognitively between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the forest , from which people depend on people , is <unk> .
you have an ethical language and a verbal language called the linguistic <unk> : you have to marry someone who speak another language .
so all of this goes back in the past , the specifics of these big houses , which are spoken by the <unk> of six or seven languages , but they &apos;re never going to hear someone who learns language .
they just listen to them , and then they start to talk .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was going to live in the year ahead of the year .
in 2025 , in 1957 , five <unk> <unk> , and made a <unk> mistake .
they were dragging out of the air out of the air , which we predicted as a friendly gesture , and then they forgot that these people had seen from the rainforest in their life , they hadn &apos;t seen something <unk> .
they took these photographs from the floor floor , tried to look at the face or to see the shape , they found nothing to be the business department of the devil , then they were killing the <unk> business of the devil , killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but the <unk> wasn &apos;t just <unk> , and they were <unk> with the spear .
they moved each other .
twenty-three percent of the deaths happened through <unk> .
we took the eight eight generations back , and we found two cases of natural death , and when we looked at people with <unk> something , they wished one of the people that was so rusty , they said he died because of his old age , and we killed it with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests that was astounding .
they could smell the urine of an original from 40 steps farther and determine depending on what cattle owned .
in the early days , i received a really astonishing job when my phd professor at harvard , i asked if i &apos;d been interested in setting up haiti and secret societies , which was used in the mid- &apos; strength and <unk> , and the poison that was used for it to make chords .
so , in order to make sense of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief , of course , of course , and <unk> is not a central magic of black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s an complex view view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them , the great world poll , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , <unk> , whatever .
one continent is left out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , and of course there &apos;s one and simply the remains of this very powerfully religious thought of the prisoner &apos;s dilemma .
but what makes interesting interesting is this living relationship between living and dead .
the living classrooms is the spirits free .
the spirits can bounce from the great water walls , respond to the rhythm of the dance to <unk> the soul of the living , so the <unk> for a brief star will become the god for a brief star for god .
<unk> people likes to say , &quot; you know , your white quote goes into church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and we will dance to god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with it , you &apos;re popping up from your mind . how can you get damage ?
so , you see these amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> lump of burning from exhaust , an astonishing visualization of the ability to affect the body &apos;s mind that it turns out when it comes into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , these were the <unk> from the sierra <unk> de <unk> in <unk> , the most extreme .
offspring of the ancient cultural civilization that <unk> <unk> from colombia , and in the aftermath of the year , went back to the <unk> of these people in a <unk> catalogue of the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only one who has never been seen from the chain .
and for the day today , they &apos;re ruled by a ritual priesthood , so the training of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> in the age of three and four years from her families separate from the <unk> world in <unk> <unk> , two periods of one of the glaciers at the <unk> of 18 years .
and during that all day , they &apos;re culturally culturally adapted into the scores of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say , environmental -- or we could maintain environmental -- balance .
and by the end of this stunning <unk> , they &apos;re taken away from one day in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a sunrise .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the elderly brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , and the destruction of the world are responsible for the destruction of the world .
so this level of caution becomes very important .
whenever we think about <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re either <unk> and the old <unk> of the noble wild , which , in his simplicity , there &apos;s a very instinctive idea , or to say , &quot; these people are deeply connected with nature than we are .
so , they &apos;re not <unk> , they &apos;re not going to go extinct from the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space in <unk> <unk> or the cold winds of tibet , but it still shaped by tibet and ritual a mysterious flow of the earth &apos;s atmosphere , which is not based on the idea that the planet can only exists on .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andean <unk> is that the mountain will grow up , the mountain will determine or their destiny will be a whole different relationship with this resource or in fact , as a small child from montana , that there is a pile of bricks that can be taken away .
whether it &apos;s a <unk> of a spirit or a pile of <unk> , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor which defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
and i grew up in the woods from <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are being there .
it took me to other people as my friends through the <unk> , who believed that these forests of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> spirits , the most <unk> of the world in the world , whatever they would participate in their <unk> .
now , if you can begin to look at the idea that these cultures can make different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , is the most powerful manual preparation from the repertoire of the <unk> .
so , what <unk> does is not just the most fundamental potential of this heat engine , but it &apos;s going on . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources on one side , there &apos;s a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , easily <unk> .
and this is a lot of a lot of very strong ones that are very similar to serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
so , if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , like you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that it contains in various ways as well .
this powder <unk> is about as much as a coconut shot , <unk> of <unk> paintings , and landing on a sea of electricity on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t generate any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
so , i even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , and the man who began the eruptions of the magic project with the discovery of the magic lifestyle in the <unk> years of talking about it . i claimed that you weren &apos;t there to hear those <unk> , you know , you &apos;re not there anymore to learn a bollywood program .
but the thing about <unk> is that they cannot be obtained , because they can &apos;t be obtained by one of the human gut , of course , <unk> <unk> .
you can only deal with those chemicals associated with some other chemicals that surround mao <unk> .
now , what &apos;s fascinating is that the oceanic tags that contain in the eyeball are <unk> , <unk> from the same way , which is necessary to ask the <unk> performance , so ask yourself yourself .
so , how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species <unk> those two <unk> crops , which , if in this way , is combined , kind of , combined with this kind of <unk> version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , attempt and error , which is as meaningless .
but you ask the americans , you say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so , what does this mean ?
and this tribe , the <unk> , they have 17 versions of <unk> , which recognizes all of them at a big distance in the forest of our eyes as a way .
and then you ask them what they call them , and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of those 17 at 17 times in <unk> , and they sing in one in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t get a doctor at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than <unk> .
well , the problem is that even those of us who have the unfortunate condition of us , the sympathy for the tough position , they look at as <unk> and <unk> , but they &apos;re kind of constrained by the past , as the real world , that our world , decides .
so , in the 20th century , in the 20th century , in 300 years not to remember his wars or <unk> , but rather than one age we were in place and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or valued . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have always risen to the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
tigers don &apos;t stopped being less in the sioux than they did an bow and time when americans stopped americans when they were horse horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> , it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ugly face of sovereignty .
and wherever you go out in the world , you &apos;ll see that these cultures are not <unk> by the end of <unk> . these are dynamic living peoples in the homeland .
or if we go into the hills of tibet , where i study a lot of research , you &apos;re going to see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> extinction by people is being judged generally , but the <unk> , the destruction of the people &apos; lifestyle , not only is not being judged , but generally and <unk> .
and you cannot understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t seen it on <unk> level .
i went out there with a young colleagues from <unk> miles in <unk> <unk> from lhasa and months and months when i saw the face behind the statistics of the people who were being interrogated into rubble and cruelty : 250 million people were assassinated during the cultural cultural cultural revolution .
the father of his young <unk> was identified as followers &apos; <unk> .
that meant that they were killed while the chinese invasions had been killed .
his uncle fled with their sanctity in the diaspora , bringing people to nepal .
his mother miraculously started as punishment as punishment for the crime .
he was smuggled in the age of two years into prison , to hide under her <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live with him .
the sister , who took these <unk> , was brought into a drug scanner .
and one day she had <unk> on a tags on her tags , and she had to <unk> her for seven years , she had to work for seven years .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of human beings is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re actually setting up a choice , and we want to live in a <unk> world of diversity , or in an interstellar world of diversity ?
margaret <unk> , who said , before she died , it was her greatest fear that , as we moved towards a string , <unk> , <unk> worldview , we were not just shutting down the entire spectrum of human imagination , but we &apos;d forgotten one day from a dream .
and it &apos;s been allowed to think that our species existed for 600,000 years now .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment , the <unk> of the <unk> framed by the <unk> of the <unk> framed by the <unk> of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and <unk> -- found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow history doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we face in the future millennia .
and if we ask these <unk> <unk> to the importance of human condition , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and so in that song , we &apos;re going to have the opportunity to be able to see what we are , people with nostrils conscious conscious conscious minds , who are aware of the importance of mankind and gardens , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a picture i took on the northern end of the northern end , when i went down with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a beautiful story of his favorites .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most degrading years of sovereignty in our sovereignty , they were forced to go to settlement in settlement .
and the grandfather &apos;s grandfather of this old man .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now , you know , these inuit members are not terrified of the cold , they used to use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their dragging were recycled from fish that became wrapped in <unk> .
man &apos;s grandfather &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear on the arctic night or the <unk> .
he <unk> out , and he dropped his shorts out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and when the feces were <unk> , they shaped it into the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the <unk> and it was completely frozen , he was carrying a dog with it .
he got the dog and <unk> a dishes , and he took the skeleton of the hindquarters and <unk> a <unk> dog , <unk> another dog , and <unk> on the <unk> with the <unk> on the table .
so you can &apos;t do anything about anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit , and from all indigenous to the world .
the canadian government gave , in april 1999 , complete complete control of an area , which is more than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new homeland , which is called <unk> .
it &apos;s a self-sufficient area . they &apos;re all <unk> .
so an astonishing example , like a nation , a state of nation can look for people to look at them .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not shutting away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination that <unk> in past times , and for each of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are becoming part of geography of geography in the geography of the hope .
what we try to do with national geographic , eventually , is that we think politicians will never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that storytelling is the world , and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website get 35 million gallons every month .
tapestries are sending us out of <unk> nations .
we &apos;ve read our magazines from millions .
and we take a series of travel into the labs that we take our audiences into places from such cultural mysteries that it <unk> from the flashy <unk> of anthropology , and hopefully , they will find one out of the world .
thanks very much .
so , what i &apos;m going to show you , as quickly as we can show , is the basic work , a new technology , which we put microsoft as a year , and it &apos;s a environment in which they can either use either local or from a large cluster of visual data .
so , we see a lot , a lot of archival books on the digital photos that you stack up and <unk> , and <unk> , in whatever ways .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these collections are or how big they are .
most of them are digital shots of a camera camera , but this one is a scan of the camera , and it &apos;s in the field of 300 predators .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing to do , because the value of a system like that , is the number of pixels on your screen in your screen right now , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from drawing , and every <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it is really about a text and it &apos;s not about a image , we can do something like this , to really make sure that this is a true visualization of the <unk> and not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an artificial way of reading .
i wouldn &apos;t deprive it .
this is an <unk> case . this is a property of the guardian .
every big picture is the dawn of a <unk> .
and that &apos;s really what the pleasure and the good experience is to read a true review of a newspaper or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did have something on the top of this particular edition of this particular edition of the guardian .
we created a false display with very high resolution , which is a lot higher than in a regular pharmaceutical ad and we added added content to it .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even engineering .
and this is really taking these ideas out , these limitations for the available position on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and other nonsense -- that meant to be not necessary .
of course , this is one of the most obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to go into this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> image of nasa .
now let &apos;s take something else out there .
so this is actually live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project with the name of <unk> , which is linked to two different kinds of technology .
one of them is <unk> , and the other is a very good research on <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> of the university of washington state by analyzing steve ballmer at the university of steve ballmer .
and rick <unk> &apos;s done from microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
and you can see that if we actually make those kinds of assumptions that we can allow through images , and we can make this experience of the <unk> resolution .
but the spatial structure of the imagery is actually looking at meaning .
and the <unk> wrote these images into the real room in which these recordings , which collected all of the <unk> parts of the box expressway , in the mid- <unk> , and they &apos;re seeing elements of <unk> slides here , and these things were added to everyone else in spatial <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to show you other places .
there are those who are much <unk> .
so , i &apos;d like to go straight one of the <unk> <unk> from noa , and this is from early prototype from <unk> to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is <unk> . and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about it because of the lawyers and so on .
so this is a <unk> of the cathedral <unk> , which has only occurred in the computers with images from flickr , and they &apos;re just trying to get from guys in t-shirts and on the <unk> etc . , each of this orange <unk> , represents a picture that was detected as to this model .
so all of these things are <unk> , and they &apos;re all <unk> in relation to each other in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
well , you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft &apos;s work on microsoft .
i &apos;m very appreciative at the reception table here .
and i think you can see that there are a lot of different kinds of cameras , there &apos;s all sorts of cameras from the surgical <unk> , and there &apos;s a pretty large number of them that have been locked in this environment .
and as possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird ones .
many of them are touched by the face . etc .
somewhere there &apos;s a series of photographs -- there are them .
this is actually a poster from notre dame , which was correctly recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
and the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , so there &apos;s data from all -- from the entire collective memory of it , from the entire collective memory of how , it looks like , and everything will interconnected with each other .
and all these photos are linked to each other , and there &apos;s something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from the entire world .
look at this as the sequel &apos; work from stephen mckinley on virtual earth .
and this is something that happens by the complexity that people use it , grow more and more likely to widen .
your own photos with metadata <unk> , which is another one else .
and if someone has been done , and all of these saints <unk> and <unk> who you are , then my photo gets from the notre <unk> of all this data , and i can use it as a starting point to enter this room , in these cases , photos photos of other people using the use of others .
and of course , byproduct all the enormously virtual models of every item of the earth that didn &apos;t just receive from <unk> or satellite data and whatnot , but through collective memory .
thanks very much .
do i understand them right ? their software is that at a certain point , in the next year , all of the pictures that are being used by someone in the world will be connected to each other in the world ?
yeah . she does nothing more than discover .
if you want them to combine <unk> between the images .
and she does this because of the nature in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , when you think about the fabric of the <unk> information , the many of these images .
like if you &apos;re doing a <unk> drawing on images , where you enter sentences and text from website , there &apos;s lots of information about it , which is image .
but what would it be like if the image is linked to all its images ?
and then the amount of <unk> <unk> , and the abundance , which comes out of it , is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic con .
blaise , which is truly incredible . congratulations congratulations .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which , like i hope , with other things you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed those things .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official <unk> is that if our goal is to maximize the common good of our citizens , especially through the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , significance , a <unk> premise of human beings .
if people have liberty , then each of us is about to do things about the things that maximize our common , and no one has to choose for us .
the path to maximize freedom is choice choice .
the more baggage people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more baggage they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deeply ingrained in our supply , that it wouldn &apos;t come into mind .
and it &apos;s also rooted deeply deeply into our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
this is my supermarkets . no big one .
i just want to say something about <unk> .
there &apos;s toyota <unk> in my supermarket , if you can &apos;t <unk> the 10 different extra <unk> , and 12 <unk> that you &apos;re able to buy a large number of salad <unk> in the united states , in the unlikely case that none of the stores in the store is right .
so this is how the supermarkets is .
and then they go to the <unk> store in a stereo shop -- speaker , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , amplifier , and there &apos;s a big shop in that kind of business store .
we can put <unk> million different <unk> together , put together into the components that will be offering business in that business .
you have to admit that there is a big choice .
in other spheres , the world &apos;s communication .
there was a time when i was a young , you could have every phone , you would have every phone that you wanted to do when he came from an ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t shut it .
a implication of it was that the phone was never broke .
these days are passed by .
we have almost an infinite array of comedy , especially in the world of the cellphone .
these are the future of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen this till now in your business , you can be sure you &apos;re going to be it soon .
and what it does is it allows people to run into slavery and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to that question is ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , which does not overdo too much .
in other aspects of life , which are much more illuminating than the purchase of objects , the same explosion of choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they &apos;re going to go into the doctor and the doctor will tell you , we could do b , or we could b b .
one has these benefits and taking risks .
b has these benefits and risk . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has got these benefits and risk , and b has got those benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you &apos;re me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i am not her . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a reflection in the burden of choosing .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing marketing system for people like you and me , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we cannot buy ?
and the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to look at the physician in the next morning and request a change of the prescription .
something more like our identity is asking a question of choice like this .
we don &apos;t <unk> identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re kind of redefining ourselves as we want to .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what to do for a type of person you want .
in marriage and family , there had been a time when it was <unk> , that almost every one had one had , and they could get them as fast as they could , and then they could get as fast as they could , and then they could get as fast kids as they could .
the only vote was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is just too simple .
i teach teaching wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re interacting with other things , they &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; do i get married or not ? &quot; am i going to marry ?
should i marry later ? i should only have kids , or do a career ? &quot;
these are all sorts of questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer those questions about whether it &apos;s going to be all the tasks i &apos;m clapping to them , and i &apos;m not going to get good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important to ask questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed with carl , like that , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day of every place on the planet -- to work on the <unk> hotel .
there &apos;s one corner i &apos;m going to tell , by the way i &apos;m not going to go to the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , which is , this incredible freedom of choice in terms of work , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing with football games , and we &apos;ve got our mobile phone on one hip and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop can probably be on our own .
and even if they &apos;re all removed , every minute in which we &apos;re looking at our child &apos;s <unk> <unk> , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take that call ?
should i respond to this email ? i should write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer is to say , &quot; no , &quot; is it going to shape your child &apos;s goal very differently than it would be .
wherever we look , big things and small things , physical things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived out looked like this .
so , i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
so , we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to get a bad thing about it .
these choices have two effects , two negatives effects on people .
the effect , the <unk> way , is that it &apos;s <unk> instead of <unk> .
with so many options you can choose , it makes people quite difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;m going to give you one more radical example of this study , which is a study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
one of my mentors from myself had access to <unk> from <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a <unk> <unk> who had the company <unk> , took action by two percent .
they offer 50 percent discount -- 10 percent less employees than if they were just five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> who are on the selection , is it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose , that they put it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never happens .
you know that it &apos;s not only meant to eat people dog food when they &apos;re going to go into the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go , it means to make sure that they miss great <unk> of their company .
by participation , they &apos;re giving up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on <unk> , who would be happy to raise their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it looks like this is what the world looks like .
you really want to make decisions really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is the effect . the other thing is that even if we went through the paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the outcome of the choices than if we had the opportunity to choose between the choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is combined with the large array of different substances , when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is <unk> , it &apos;s been able to make a difference .
the more options that we have , the easiest way to do it is not to regret it in the choice of choice .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has a big point of view this morning by looking at how much the way we grade things we think about it , which is what we contrast to it .
well , if there are very many countries to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive to look attractive to the alternatives you agree , that makes them feel less satisfied with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s one example . those of you who are not new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they were supposed to think .
here &apos;s a couple of the <unk> .
very expensive luxury .
beautiful beach : great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could better be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it is august .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone away .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spent 2 weeks from the thought that he &apos;s going to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to have a great common spot .
<unk> , the enjoyment of which we get through our selection , even though what we &apos;ve selected is fantastic .
and the more ways that we have the choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are into account into <unk> properties .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon does some statements .
he makes a point of living in now life , and maybe things too slow to do things about it .
but one important point that he &apos;s done is whenever they deciding one thing they don &apos;t choose to do , they don &apos;t choose other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do .
third , institutional expectations of expectations .
this has struck me when i try to encourage my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there &apos;s a time in which there were only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve got bad <unk> , they &apos;ve been incredibly vocal , and if they &apos;ve cleaned them long enough , they &apos;ve got plenty of <unk> .
so , i went to buy new jeans after many years of the old age of old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want <unk> , <unk> ? &quot;
do you climb buttons or dials ? &quot; soda or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d like to cut down at the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah , blah , &quot; and so on , he talked about it .
my jaws went down , and after i finished , i said , &quot; i would like to have the way that used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what it was , so i spent an hour with all of these damn jeans <unk> , and he got the business -- and i say the best best thing i had to do .
i felt better . all those choices allowed me to do it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and try to explain myself .
the reason that i felt was worse , with all these available options , my expectations of what was going on for a good bunch of jeans , going up .
i had very low expectations . i had no specific expectations than it was just in a way .
when they arrived in 100 ways , damn one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so what i did was , i expected what i expected what i expected , and what i had was expected to do with what i expected .
adding ways to affect people &apos;s lives , inevitably , people will argue about it as well as good as these options are going to be as good as these people are going to be .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world knows this , because if you &apos;d like it , you know , you wouldn &apos;t all know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that used to be done was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to experience with people who were a comfortable surprise .
so , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best thing you can hope to do , which is as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to cybercrime -- which is what they &apos;ve all got -- the secret to the <unk> is low expectations .
i want to say -- i &apos;m a short <unk> moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have it better . i couldn &apos;t have it better .
but <unk> isn &apos;t always a bad thing .
finally , one string of the <unk> of bad seats , if there &apos;s only one way to go out , if they &apos;re mind-wandering , and they &apos;re wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is , the answer is accountable . what would they have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re going to buy one that &apos;s <unk> , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
so , it &apos;s also clear that the answer is the question : you .
they would better do it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for error .
and so when people make decisions , and even if the results are good , they feel frustrated about it , they accuse themselves about it , they accuse themselves .
so clinically depressed <unk> in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> explosion of this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experience the same , because their standards are so high . and then , if you have these experiences themselves , you think it would be your fault .
and so the ironic thing is that it gets better at us , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which we all think about correctly , is totally wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that a choice is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choices better than anything .
there &apos;s a magical host . i don &apos;t know what it is .
and i &apos;m quite sure that we have that point long enough to affect the choice of our success .
now , as an principle question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as an policy question , the thing about the idea is , what all these choice allowed in the developed societies , the material , is wealth .
there are many sites in the world , and we &apos;ve heard from many of them whose problems is not the big choice .
their problem is they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s frustrating and frustrating , is , steve ballmer told you yesterday about how these expensive cost and difficult to go to <unk> car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just simply that they &apos;re not help .
they even hurts .
they &apos;re worried that we are doing worse there .
so , if something from what the people of our society allowed to make choices in people with little choice , would not only improve people &apos;s lives , but we could also improve the lives of human beings , but we also could become better .
economists call this <unk> application .
<unk> is going to make everybody better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are <unk> us .
by closing , you &apos;re reading this cartoon , and , you know , this is a sophisticated person , says , &quot; aha ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came up with the idea that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that when they break the <unk> , they have no freedom . they have no freedom . they have paralysis .
if you break the <unk> so that it &apos;s done , you lower your satisfaction .
they increases the paralysis and slightly lower the satisfaction .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost bounded with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> hangs by a metaphor of <unk> is a recipe for misery , and , i think , <unk> .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome , and what it could mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
we actually start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology and create new life .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what life is ? it &apos;s something i think a lot of biologists have tried to understand and do it on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried many different approaches trying to make it look at the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years old , and as we sequenced it , we &apos;ve applied to the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of computers .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate or if we can create new life , or can we make new life , from that universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , a little <unk> , the smallest genome of a species that can replicate in the lab , and we have tried to do it with another smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about 100 genes from 500 or something that we have here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , relative to ours . trust me , this is simple . but if we look at each of those genes , it would be very unlikely that this is going to lead to the living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward , that chromosome , to synthesize the chromosome , which allows us to vary the single components and ask some of those fundamental questions .
and so , we started with the question , can we synthesize a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to create those really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can do that , then we can start up the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical chemical material .
our steps at the millions of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly but further , and our last point now would put on an exponential curve .
we started about 15 years ago .
it took a lot of years before it took a test review before we did the first experiments before we did the first experiments .
turns out it turns very hard very difficult .
there &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world can make the little pieces of dna about dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a continuous process , so the longer you do a piece , which is more errors .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put those little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting starting with the digital information , by the genome x 174 x 174 .
it &apos;s a small bacteria killing bacteria .
we made small pieces of stuff , put a dna molecule and had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical molecule and put it into a bacteria , and then the bacteria started to read the genetic code and made viral particles .
and the viral particles then got pulled from the cells , and then they came back and kill e. coli .
recently , i talked about the oil industry , and they said they wanted to understand this model .
they laughed more than you did it .
so , we think that this is a situation in the process in which software actually can build its own source in a biological system .
but we wanted a lot more radical . we wanted to build an entire chromosome chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters genetic coded , so we thought , we build it from the size of the virus that we could vary with the size of the living cell .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re going to start with digital information technology in the computer , this digital information has to be really accurate .
when we sequenced the genome we first sequenced in 1995 , it was <unk> with a failure per 10,000 base pairs .
we discovered in the <unk> 30 mistake . if we were using the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
one part of the designs is to make payments for 50 letters long , and they have to compete with other memorials that fit them together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have patrons of <unk> .
think about it : we have a do-it-yourself coded code : a , c , g. , g. and t.
and <unk> of these letters -- these letters coded about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single layer of purpose for each of those amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , phrases , thoughts .
at first , we signed it only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the artifacts that we could just simply dissociate them with bacteria , and then there are enzymes to repair those things and rebuild them .
and we started creating pieces of paper , starting with mixing letters up by bethlehem letters , put those together together in order to make these compasses together .
in each step , we could put those slices into the brain so we could sequencing it because we &apos;re trying to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to go to the point of view .
so , this looks like a coastline .
so , if we get to get those right big -- with 100,000 base pairs -- they won &apos;t just grow into e. coli . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we applied to others .
we knew it from a method called <unk> <unk> , which is used for biology to determine dna , those artifacts can synthesize those artifacts .
here &apos;s one example . there &apos;s one organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
twelve to 24 hours later , they put together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms to do this .
these organisms can be quite <unk> , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life can exist in space and move on to <unk> conditions .
indeed , nasa has shown that there are a lot of them out there .
so here &apos;s a <unk> from the molecule we used by using these processes -- actually , we used abs techniques using the right design of the pieces , we put them together ; they put them together automatically then .
this is not a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are photos about a duration of six seconds .
this is the publication we only did recently .
these are over <unk> letters of <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule on <unk> structure that has been created by human beings .
it has a wingspan of about 300 million .
if we could print it out by a factor of 10 and no longer distances , it would cost <unk> pages , except for those genetic code , it &apos;s just about these genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activating it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re doing it in <unk> like we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out and you put another in there , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clones .
in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell , but first recently , we &apos;ve shown that if we can do a complete transplant molecule from one cell to the other , and it can be activating .
we put the chromosome in the chromosome . so , roughly said , these are either two blocks from each other and mice . we put a florescent tag on that chromosome . and it was very surprising to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , what we thought here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to keep trying to bring things forward .
this is the evolution of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome or a third chromosome or a third of every one thousand links in just one second to a species .
so people think of evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of biology with a lot of biology .
there are also enzymes called <unk> , they &apos;re actually <unk> dna , they &apos;re actually printing dna .
the chromosome that in the cell was none ; the chromosomes that we have jumped in .
it became <unk> in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we ended up using a cell with a new chromosome .
it turns out blue because of the genes we had put in there .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species and <unk> entirely into a new species on the new software that we put in the cell .
so , all the proteins changed themselves -- when we read the genetic code -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we did .
it sounds like genomic <unk> , but we can rotate by changing things , things quite dramatically .
now i &apos;m going to argue that this is not the <unk> -- based on 3.5 billion years of evolution evolution .
and i &apos;ve speculated that perhaps we &apos;re able to actually create a new form of the ocean explosion in which there might be massive new <unk> in there on this arcane design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s quite obviously about what we need to do .
we &apos;re from six billion to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in perspective , i was born born in the year .
today , three people in this planet has existed for every one who has existed in the year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh water and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it becomes a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion <unk> oil . these are 100 million gallons of the day .
if we think about biological processes or some processes to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes on the atmosphere .
we have now , from our exploration from all around the world , a database containing about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen core core components , and look at the diversity that arose from it .
we come up with the first line at the beginning of the biological reality and the idea of the idea .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of this rapid molecule due to what we call <unk> genetics .
we now have the opportunity to create a big robot to create the millions of chromosomes a day .
so , if you think about those 20 million disparate genes , or these processes to optimize hydrogen sulfide , or drug new vaccines , we can start with a single small team of molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> production , production of chemicals , or <unk> , and so on .
this is a shot from ernst <unk> who we &apos;re working with actually <unk> and new species on the computer
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it looks like , but we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re focusing now on some of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have input from the production generation and third generation , which are pretty soon going to come up with a lot higher levels of roads , like ariel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way we think about it , the only way we think about it is going to have a big impact on food , or the limitation of its availability , when we &apos;re seeing co2 as primary , and therefore , we &apos;re working on cells that way .
and we think we &apos;ll be the first resort to the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and this is about 18 months later .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
and yet , in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different kinds of different organisms .
this is one organism we have described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it turns out co2 emissions in methane , by using hydrogen as energy as hydrogen sulfide .
we can look at whether we can use co2 emissions , which can just be brought to <unk> , eliminating the co2 in fuel to make this process .
in a short span of span , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
so , you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like the <unk> of the <unk> industry -- exactly . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where anyone could do it ?
but we currently work on trying to use the same approach to development vaccines .
so , you saw this year with flu , and we &apos;re seeing a little bit back at the back of it , and we have a dollar too little , if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that it can be changed by providing vaccines in the <unk> vaccines .
and that &apos;s what the future might look like , with changes today , can accelerate today with synthetic bacteria , <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps <unk> .
we &apos;re living light years from it to people , and our goal is to survive a long enough enough to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised myself to try to explain how the machine works .
so here it is . and for those of those who were not there at the time , the large biodiversity is the largest scientific solution ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second in the universe , existed at 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just sheer cones .
this is the actual machine below from geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> images in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas at the atlas of the atlas in the world , looking at the scale .
on the 10th of september last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it does have huge shifts in the inside of the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> route all the route to the large hadron collider , trying to drag a piece of subatomic particles to make a rain on the detector .
in other words , when we saw that picture in the 10th of september , we knew that the engine works , what was a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created by the largest <unk> , or when someone went to renew the google page and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact beyond scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with this wires here -- these golden wires .
these wires <unk> <unk> when the engine &apos;s running on <unk> .
well , the engineers amongst you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do it , because if you get it very far off , you &apos;re going to go into something called <unk> .
so at the dark minimum , cooler than the space between the stars , those wires can be able to withstand those wires .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the large hadron collider , there was a <unk> .
and so the wires put together and <unk> <unk> , obviously , of course , <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
well , everything &apos;s even amazing when you imagine that magnet weigh over 20 tons of time and shifting about 30 centimeters .
so we also damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to take them apart what we did .
we &apos;re <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back again on their way back .
by march , the lhc will be <unk> again .
we &apos;ll turn it on , and we &apos;ll look at first data on june first data in june or july , and we &apos;re leaving our journey to try to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , as a kind of evolution , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> at the same time -- it &apos;s easy to dismiss something like this .
i think it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we reaching beyond our envelope , forms the value of things like the large hadron collider .
i &apos;m going to leave my biblical words to leave an english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who , as i guess , said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind . &quot;
thanks very much .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more of course than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifetime love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect to think that &apos;s going to be going to change .
though , there &apos;s been a little bit weird in my life , and my career has taken me to rethink my relationship with that work .
in this case , i was writing a book recently about a book -- a bio named <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , which was demolished in the world , for whatever reason i had gone out into the world .
the result is that i will , no matter where i come from , i will be treated by the doom .
seriously , the dark <unk> !
for example , they come up with me and say , &quot; do you fear this success ? &quot;
don &apos;t they have a fear of knowing that they &apos;ve done their whole life , and they never create a book that anyone cares about in the world ? never again ?
okay , so that &apos;s really really empowering .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember it about 20 years ago , when i first told myself that i wanted to be a writer in the same way that i was confronted by the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , &quot; <unk> , you don &apos;t have a fear of no success ? &quot;
do you have a fear that you kill the abject narrative ?
don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re not afraid of this program for your life , and you &apos;ve never got something that you will die on a <unk> dreams -- your mouth <unk> with the bitter <unk> of failure ? <unk> <unk> with the bitter <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had to do it .
and i have a lot more kind of fearful of fear that no one would have a clue .
like algae -- and other regarding things .
but , when i think about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i wonder why ?
is it <unk> ?
is it logical from someone who was supposed to be fearful of doing the work that he wants to do .
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative enterprises is that they &apos;re insecure with the attributes of mental health -- in a way they don &apos;t do other professions ?
my dad , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40s , as a chemist , where he was asked if he was afraid of being chemist .
by your teammates , john -- how do you deal with it ?
it just popped off , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist have not been obtained by the <unk> of <unk> people .
so , we seem writers to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all <unk> , seem to be mental terribly complicated .
all you have to do is look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds in the 20th century , who are young and often from their own .
and even those who don &apos;t actually <unk> <unk> , seemed neglected from their talents to be neglected .
norman <unk> said a little interview about his death in his last interview : <unk> any of my books has killed me a little bit more .
there &apos;s a extraordinary statement they can do about her work .
but we don &apos;t even realize if we heard someone like this , because we know this kind of statements since such a long period of time , somehow we &apos;ve embraced the notion of creativity and collective accepted , that creativity and suffering somehow leads .
the question i &apos;m going to ask today is : is this idea for you absolutely ok ?
do you feel it ? because with just one centimeter perspective -- i feel not comfortable with that idea whatsoever .
i find them <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to see how it &apos;s taken into the next century .
i find it better when we encourage our great creative studies .
and i definitely know that for me , it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start out , this dark path of the guess -- especially in my career , in my career right now , in my career right now .
it &apos;s called -- look : i am pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 billion <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s probably likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is being done by the world as well as the default success of my last book , right ?
i call it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s probably the most likely my biggest success -- it &apos;s probably the most likely my biggest success behind me .
oh jesus , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of ideas that can make people start nine a.m. at nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather prefer to continue doing that work i love .
so the question is : how ?
for a few years of publishing , i think i needed to continue to write , design a kind of <unk> psychological user .
somehow i have to find from a way that i &apos;m going to find out a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> on how the response to the writing is going to be on the writing .
as i looked for models in the past year , and i tried to look at other societies in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they were linked to how to help creativity with the emotional risks that are linked to creativity .
and this helps me to the old malaria and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in fact , in old <unk> and rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from people , ok ?
they felt creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which comes from an distant , unknown source to people -- from <unk> , unknown , unknown reasons .
the greeks named these <unk> <unk> creativity of creativity among creativity .
from socrates , he said he believed him , he had a <unk> , he delivered him from fort farther .
the roman had the same idea , called the <unk> creative mind , was a <unk> genius <unk> .
it &apos;s great . the roman didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly clever person .
they believed that a genius of this kind of magical <unk> , believed that it was literally living in the walls of a golf ball -- something like bermuda , the <unk> and the artist in the process of doing , in the work , as well as the result of doing the work .
this is brilliant -- there is the distance i was talking about -- the act of what i was talking about from the follow of your work .
and everybody knew it so worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was protected by some kind of stuff , like , for example , <unk> <unk> , right ?
when your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything to you , everybody knew that you had this pointillist genius that helped you .
if your work <unk> -- isn &apos;t entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew their genius was something paralyzed .
so people think of a lot of creativity in the west for creativity .
and then the renaissance , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human perspective on the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there is no room for western creatures to take the orders from the divine .
it is at the beginning of the rational humanism , and people started thinking creativity completely from their own individual tapestries .
now , for the first time in history , you hear people call a genius of this , or instead of calling it a genius .
i have to tell you , i think , that was a big mistake .
so , you know ? i think a mere person is trying to think that he &apos;s like the harbor , like the basins and the essence of all divine , creative , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a little bit too much of responsibility to create a <unk> , human mind .
it &apos;s like someone to ask the sun .
the ruined and it cuts itself and it creates all of these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> of our artists has been annihilated by the past 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , -- and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative clubs .
perhaps not .
perhaps , we can &apos;t <unk> the <unk> out of 500 years , rational humanism just in a <unk> lecture .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience , who &apos;s really interested in some scientific scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you to take that trip .
but the question i want to ask is : why not ?
why don &apos;t you think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense why everything else i heard , when it was about trying to explain the totally crazy manual of the creative process .
it &apos;s a process that -- like everybody knows , who has ever been trying to do something -- in other words , in other words , in fact , everybody here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , sometimes they can feel really quite a bit more pleasant .
i had recently had such an encounter as i was approaching the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone for 90 , but she told me that she was when she was growing up in <unk> virginia , and she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she would feel like a poem on the landscape of her landscape .
she said it would like a <unk> match out of air .
the country on her country would be <unk> .
she felt if it popped off , because it would take the earth under its feet .
she knew that she was able to do that at one moment , and that was -- in their words -- <unk> race like the devil .
they run out of the poem as they were haunted by this poem . it was only about being fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen pen , so they could capture it as it was through them , catching on and on top of that sheet .
in other paintings , they were not fast enough . they ran and ran and run , but they didn &apos;t miss the house and the poem rolled through her , and she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; <unk> , look for another nation . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said there were moments in which she was almost retrospective in them .
so , she runs to the house , and she &apos;s got to go through the poem , and she goes through her , and she grabs a pen straight as it goes through her and then -- she said -- she was like to grab out with her other hand and grab it .
she was dragging the poem at his tail , and she moved back into her body , and she took her on the sheet of paper .
and at these times , the poem came out and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and as i heard that , i thought , <unk> -- this is exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the <unk> !
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to get up to work every day at the same time , and sweat , and sweat , and really uncomfortable .
but even i myself in my office , sometimes this thing .
and i appreciate many of them too .
even i had work or ideas from a source of myself , which i can &apos;t really relate to .
what &apos;s this thing for a thing ?
and , how do we deal with losing our minds without losing our minds , but to keep us in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this , the musicians tom <unk> , and i was allowed to interview him a couple of years ago for a magazine .
so we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s <unk> &apos;s embodiment , who was trying to do these <unk> creative impulses that lived in him and with them with them .
but then he got older and more calm , and he told me that he was driving one day in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he rides with high speed when he first heard a little patch of tune in , which is what it does with us a little bit , it &apos;s hard to tangibilitate it . and he wants to do it . it &apos;s <unk> . he &apos;s <unk> afterwards , but he can &apos;t .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen pen .
so , he starts going up these old <unk> in him , like , for example , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to go through this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just stopped .
he finished all of the time , and did something completely new .
he looked just in the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , couldn &apos;t you see that i &apos;m parked ? <unk> .
i don &apos;t look at this stuff like i could just write a song about it ?
if you want to truly exist , come back to a <unk> second time when i could take care of yourself .
if not , you know somebody else .
and <unk> leonard cohen .
his whole life has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was continued to have as dark as ever as ever as ever as ever as ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him was recorded , which was recorded from it , where it had nothing to come from in trouble , and then he realized that it had not to be a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and <unk> , physical thing , which was not entirely tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i did , and it saved me once .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> . i fell in one of these specimens that we all fall in , when we work on something and it &apos;s not going to work . you &apos;ll begin to think it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is going to be the worst book .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
i started thinking , i was just going to try reverse-engineering the project .
but then i remember thinking about tom in the free sky , and i tried to do it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and my commentary on the direction of empty space .
i was talking loudly , <unk> , you , and i know both , if this book is not perfect , that it &apos;s not my fault , that it &apos;s not my fault , right ?
because you see everything i have , i &apos;m creating everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to do it better , you &apos;ve got to put it up there and apply your proportion of the deal .
ok . but if you don &apos;t do it -- you know what , you know , the hell of it .
i &apos;m going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to go to the conclusion that i was here for the part of the jobs .
because ... in the end , it &apos;s like following . centuries of centuries ago , faced with <unk> <unk> people with sacred dances and <unk> , who stopped spending time -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something happened , and one of the performers actually turned out , and one of the performers actually turned out .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen everyone in your life .
it was taken as though , and the dancers used to walk through some kind of <unk> . they did nothing differently than they did -- they did nothing differently than they did -- but everything else they got together .
and , of course , he never appeared more into human human rights .
it became lit from inside , and from the bottom , and it was lit up by a <unk> fire .
as something happened at the time , people knew what it was . they called it in his name .
they put together the hands together and started sing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting ancient <unk> , when the balinese carpenters moved from <unk> into this practice , and they changed their practice throughout the year of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is still known for <unk> and <unk> .
if an performers in spain <unk> , something magical has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and there it is : a <unk> look at god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but the tricky part goes on in the next morning , if the dancer himself wakes up and realizing it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s not longer a <unk> of god in himself .
he &apos;s merely a <unk> <unk> with <unk> knee , and perhaps he will never go again to those times .
and perhaps , again , someone will never be calling from god &apos;s name , if it turns out , but what to do with the rest of his life ?
it &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most accurate elements of creative life .
but perhaps it doesn &apos;t have to be fully <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe from the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of existence come from you .
so , if you just think that you &apos;re on a loan -- from an oceanic source source of time for a <unk> period of your life that will be passed on to someone else when they &apos;re done .
if we start thinking about it , everything is changing .
so , i started thinking , well , i certainly think about the last few months , as i was working on the book that will be soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , a very expected descendants of my <unk> .
what i constantly have to tell myself is , when i &apos;m going to talk about it , i don &apos;t have fear .
it &apos;s not <unk> .
just do your job .
stayed for your contribution , whatever it is for him to be .
when your job is dancing , dance .
if the genius &apos;s genius who would give you to the side , decides , for a short instant frame of wonder through your effort , then <unk> <unk> .
and if not , dance is the dance .
and <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> for you , despite all of this .
i believe in it , and i feel that we should be learning .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , for all of you , is that you love the only human love and the <unk> thing to be there for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
a-ha !
last year , i showed those two slides to illustrate that the artic <unk> , which had declined for nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states , increases 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press a lot of the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t look at the thickness of ice .
in a way , the artic heart is beating the beating heart of our global ocean .
they grow in the winter and contracting during the summertime .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show is something that happened in the last 25 years .
and the <unk> is tagged by red .
you see , as you can see , it &apos;s done on the <unk> , so this is the annual ice in the winter , and it &apos;s summertime .
what &apos;s called <unk> , five years old , is almost like blood , which is <unk> from the body here .
in 25 years , it will be gone from here to this .
this is a problem because the warming of the frozen ocean is ocean heat for the arctic ocean , which is large amounts of carbon pollution , which is , when it comes from microbes to methane .
compared with the total amount of additional contaminants in the atmosphere , it could double double the weight if we &apos;re approaching this critical point .
already today , in some shallow knee-deep in alaska from even the water from the water .
professor <unk> <unk> , at the university of alaska , with one more stable in the university of china .
wow !
you &apos;re going to go well . the question is , how is it going to come up with us .
and one reason , this enormous reservoir is melting greenland from north greenland .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are substantially bigger than the one before .
this is the namibian river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rose is going up here , it &apos;s going to go into the ocean .
these rivers are getting very short .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest exporter on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has been undergoing a makeover .
and the <unk> who showed up about some of the <unk> is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up the top new lakes that had glaciers in front of a few years ago .
40 percent of all people around the world get half of their <unk> out of this <unk> .
in the concept , these glaciers are the <unk> for these city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but when they <unk> , most of the drinking water will be <unk> .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of reduction in smallpox was seen .
this is the <unk> environment .
and the predictions , as you &apos;ve read them , are serious .
these vectors <unk> in the world leads to a desperate raise of fire .
and the catastrophes anywhere in the world have come up with a real <unk> and gained unprecedented rate .
four times a lot in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is a totally gratuitous fibroid .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it looks like .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve done 70 million tons of co2 on co2 emissions , every 24 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the domain of the eastern pacific ocean , from the american continent west and <unk> <unk> of indian peacekeepers , where there &apos;s a kind of a <unk> decline of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest factor for global warming , by deforestation , which 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and it &apos;s the limiting biggest problem .
the united states is one of the united states together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more co-developers .
but we &apos;re beginning to see change change .
here are the ones taken out in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been suggested .
there &apos;s a political struggle in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a dollar service last week trying to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
for christmas day , i walked around in tennessee , in tennessee , a billion tons of tons of grass .
they saw it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> america .
this is about christmas day .
one of the <unk> commercials was about christmas time .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , happy guy .
there is it in the envelope and abundance in america , and it helps us to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> , is every day clean .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> and workers stay in charge and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the manager of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so , the alliance for climate change has dropped two benefits into life .
this is one , a part of her .
in the discussion of climate change , we see climate change as a serious danger of our business .
so , we put it on top of the top oil , which is a considerable route to spend a petition route on the way that we get from coal .
in fact , coal isn &apos;t dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and actually smells good well .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s go ahead and do this .
<unk> charcoal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , green <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loudly .
but it &apos;s the sound of the green competition .
and yet , the burning from coal is about the global warming , which is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here , changing everything .
so , look at it closely , this is what we have today , clean regulations .
finally mixed up with the positive option with our economic challenge , and our grand challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
so the red thread , which is all linked , is our dependence upon 67 fuels like dirty coal and nuclear oil .
but now there is a new , new solution to make us out of this <unk> device .
<unk> america by 100 percent clean electricity , in the next 10 years , <unk> electricity in the next 10 years .
trying to get america back to work , to make us safer , to help us to stop global warming .
finally , one solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america is new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a quarter of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on old , dirty fuels that our world is falling down .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , trying to create a good job of creating jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s old african african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go down .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to get very far , and really quickly .
thanks very much .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you to start out of your childhood when they were playing with <unk> <unk> .
while they realized how to maximize their hands out and <unk> , <unk> <unk> and exercise , they were actually able to start thinking about solving and <unk> problems with the understanding of the mind .
the spatial belief is deeply deeply linked to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interactions with real objects , and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , so i started to wonder : what if we could use computers instead of a shallow cherry ?
and this question was so deeply that we decided we decided to fix the answer and evolve .
in short , a video projector is an interactive computer in the size of a corporation .
you can run by hand , you can detect each other , you can detect each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen .
more importantly , they &apos;re physically , which is why you can &apos;t move them out through the roof of your hands and get access to your hands .
and the <unk> is an example of a new generation of engineering on the manipulation of digital information .
and if these tools become physical and conscious for their movements , they develop each other and the edges of our bodies with them , then we can begin to explore new and more entertaining societies .
i &apos;m going to start with some basic examples .
this is <unk> <unk> , and as i put it into a direction , it &apos;s going to play the video game forward , and if i push it into the other direction , it &apos;s going to work backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side side side , you &apos;ll see that your interests .
if they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll find that too and they can get something nervous .
and they also feel like they feel their movements and slope .
an interesting implication of the interactions we started to describe was that we could use everyday gestures gestures on data , like if you could use it with the <unk> .
in this case , we have three oxygen sensors than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to put color in the middle in the middle , where they &apos;re then mixed together .
if we overdo it , we can &apos;t <unk> a little bit .
there are also also some kind of nice ways in education like languages , mathematics , or <unk> , where we give people the chance of testing the fast trial and then they want to see the results .
here i am , this is a series i &apos;m launching with a simple <unk> device .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get every round of round random at random random letters , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;re looking for a dictionary .
then , for about 30 seconds , again , it turns together , and you have a new <unk> and new possibilities .
thanks very much .
so , these are some children who came on a trip to the media lab , and i couldn &apos;t get them to try and take a video from it .
they really loved it .
one more interesting situation in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; forms words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our recent <unk> <unk> there on the right .
it turns out they were only <unk> <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is an interactive camera .
we wanted to develop a design curriculum for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by positioning at the <unk> from the table , which is this shape .
here he <unk> the sun .
the sun is going on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the <unk> , and they can flip side side by side , they can interact with the characters .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end , and he can decide how they develop .
flying cat .
so , the last example i have today is to show it , which is a project for <unk> , which we recently developed and <unk> as notes , like ariel and <unk> and whatever .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put those notes into the sequence that you can put in certain patterns .
and you put them together by just trying to put a coconut processor on a <unk> basis .
there are effects that you can change live , like reverberation and filter .
you put it together with a particular clay , and then it turns it to set up .
and then even more problematic effects like speed and volume you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at this .
we begin to start by posing the <unk> in two panels , and those in a row , you add and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a painting .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
and now i &apos;m going to push the filter out with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence by moving at the speed of one or another .
and now i &apos;m still going to push the filter out with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it goes through it .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but they can improvise them ; they develop them faster or more short .
and then finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence of the boat by drawing the <unk> on the left .
thank you very much .
so , as you can see , my intuitions about trying to develop new vocabulary , the better way to look at brains like our brains and bodies .
and today , i had time to show you a part of these new <unk> and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to attach to you about the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of interactions with the interactions with the digital media that we bring in our way .
thank you very much .
i look forward to conversations with them all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m excited that i &apos;m there .
so , what is supposed to be ?
i just have to go back to a little bit of <unk> , namely , <unk> <unk> with modern molecular molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i just have a couple of years ago with the <unk> , and i started because i just wanted to know , and it wanted to make sense of what i learned in economics , and i wanted to do what i learned in theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so , it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think molecular biology in general , so generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you do , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is already very important , and yet a lot more importantly is going to be more important in the future .
there &apos;s so detailed things like this all these genetically modified plants on the <unk> .
there are craig venter in the <unk> who &apos;s trying to make <unk> , so gasoline out of algae .
among then , there are things that are totally involved in the ground , which is , most people don &apos;t realize , for example , <unk> <unk> , which allows us to wash away with thermal degrees of laundry .
and the list can continue on you .
and so from the point of view on this technology , i &apos;m just going to keep banging on on this technology .
now what why now ?
most people know that most people know about the <unk> .
computers , and then it will be used in the media forever , yes , and the hackers will break somewhere into it , and so on .
so , this is very sad , because it &apos;s actually very sad , because it doesn &apos;t really matter what they actually did , and what it does is actually true .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about designing a playful , creative , artistic way of trying to solve a problem .
and so , this is not just an engineering problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a four-month term of stuff like things like things , so you can do it differently , and you can do it differently , or you can do it differently .
and it &apos;s got started off with software stuff , but it &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole host of equipment , which has to do with <unk> all sorts of <unk> things .
and now there &apos;s also kind of biology , and there &apos;s a metaphor from synthetic biology coming out of synthetic biology , taking biology , is a abstract coded solution , which is dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , so it &apos;s property , so it &apos;s actually dark matter , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also programming it , and you can also <unk> it , so , and i think it &apos;s incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper into it .
this really wasn &apos;t supposed to adopted eight grand forms , these mesh networks .
there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but by now , members or active people around the world .
so , there &apos;s a version of art orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and interacting with scientists trying to interact with those sorts of technologies and ask questions and creative , and there &apos;s no way to do it .
but it &apos;s really always about trying to find such a <unk> access to that kind of thing .
and then there &apos;s <unk> up there , <unk> <unk> .
this is from the network of a network , which is actually kind of a kind of forum where where you hang yourself , and you &apos;re talking online .
it &apos;s a little bit technical <unk> and also a little bit later on , and there will be a little bit of technical questions , and then they &apos;re also going to ask <unk> questions .
and from these networks that the entire popular world has done , so they &apos;ve developed a scene that i just briefly want to talk about .
here in the picture on the top left , you see <unk> , which is a private school , basically a kind of school , a private school , nonprofit institution , where everyone can come to where everyone can come .
kids , old , all kinds of people are going to go up there just by measuring themselves , they put a lab lab , and they look at what they can do , and they look at what they can do when these deletions .
there &apos;s a group in indonesia on the left , which is called <unk> , which is , there &apos;s a lot of a lot of time .
it has been more than these two networks .
they also have an artistic aspect of knowledge in such an artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , <unk> , and combine this in kind of a <unk> way .
a group of ankara that i used for a while a while ago , who wanted to give people to the public domain of what they wanted in college , and they &apos;ve done so on in college , and they &apos;ve done so on <unk> small actions , and people try to explain what <unk> is .
and i put up on top in the other side of the picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the afghan museum in <unk> with an exhibition on the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , this is the most important young people , but the only thing , what what the hell is , is this fascination with the technology .
and what you can do , and we can also target very specifically on society and asking , so , ok , what you want , what you do , you put your interest in that way you add up to it ?
so , <unk> , now , to make biology , you need a kind of material .
you need organic materials , obviously , and you need tools , and that &apos;s then a lab .
or what you normally find out under a lab , which is somewhat expensive machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , highly effective professionals , just unskilled academics , trained academics with doctor and so on .
and our approach was to say , well , <unk> , that really doesn &apos;t have to do it .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because every every one of every <unk> has actually dropped more sophisticated technology than most <unk> , which is really true .
and the premise of this premise , for example , brian <unk> in britain , for example , a <unk> <unk> , has taken such a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yes , it turns out , and then it has bred bacteria , working with bacteria .
so , one of the <unk> <unk> is that he has left too long .
so , i went out on my lab , and i try to skip a little bit , and then i did a little bit of a <unk> analysis on ebay , and a little bit of analysis analysis , trying to do that .
now , this is not supposed to be a joke now , but it &apos;s actually not going to be a joke now .
so here in the face , you see the lab , in <unk> , so there &apos;s a <unk> garage with there , so there &apos;s a group in <unk> , which is a group in paris that are setting up and quite quite interesting things , because i &apos;m going to go there too .
and this is <unk> , which is also called <unk> , which is , as a sort of <unk> principle , basically for molecular biology .
and so , you know , it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively relatively <unk> , so there are people doing it at home , to too large , major organizations that are going on in <unk> fashion .
but always always the way that it &apos;s easy and it &apos;s accessible to it .
so the first project we did when we have an international group , as we were discovering ourselves , <unk> , and there are now as real scene as it is , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re so familiar to people that are always more and more and so .
and then it came from the <unk> website website , and it said <unk> , so we must actually meet as well , as real meeting , and then has two distinct events , one in london , <unk> 10 , and short of that in the <unk> , in san francisco , in san francisco .
and , then , there &apos;s also about it , yes , who is , of course , who are we , what are we going to do , which is what we want to say , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our teammates , our foundations ?
and then we have a <unk> <unk> .
so that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got his desires , his and what it &apos;s like to hang on him , saying , &quot; then .
so , in my opinion , i think a whole good piece of code was actually done .
and we haven &apos;t yet to dig it , but that &apos;s the point of view , but it &apos;s still , i think , has done fairly well , so people are quite convinced of this .
and we even try to get that into the academic world again , but it &apos;s kind of not there somehow .
so , i think we &apos;re from the scientific <unk> , in fact , even one step further than the scientific world .
so , what kind of projects do we do now ?
one of the things i did with the apple <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to construct a so-called optical capture or optical performance .
so , if you zoom in a beam beam in a room , you can catch with little particles in this room , or in fact , in this focus , and then you &apos;re stuck in there , so that &apos;s kind of stuck there like this .
it really does work in academic journals , and we thought , <unk> , <unk> , we might also have a webcam , the renderings , the lens of <unk> , turns off , then you &apos;ve got a microscope , which is heightened about <unk> .
this is what you see here .
and then we &apos;ve got a laser beam <unk> <unk> and the laser beam the laser beam and then trying to try to focus on that camera .
and it didn &apos;t really work out , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it yet .
so another project that comes from from the french group in paris , who worked out of paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and so , he has so much like this , so <unk> , so <unk> or so forth , so he &apos;s engaged in <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he then went and built this on this axis of cooperation , and in cooperation with the museum of cooperation .
and then , there could go to the public in the room , sit down on this chair , sit on this chair .
then they &apos;ve measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they &apos;ve thought , or what they &apos;ve thought , is they &apos;ve gone through different lights in space .
was quite a pretty pretty <unk> project .
another thing from the united states that has to do with this doggy point of view is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , that is the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , which is able to multiply , <unk> , pull apart , so you can make them visible .
so now , when i do this , the <unk> step at the scene , then go track and do some kind of stuff , and then they do these analysis , and then they can go , <unk> , and they can say , &quot; <unk> , that &apos;s about this hair . &quot;
and the machines that are doing something like this , which is quite expensive , which you buy , the easiest way to buy , the cheapest buy .
and this is not in silicon , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is also a lot of it .
so this is just a application of a lot that you can do with it .
and they have so two two hobbyists <unk> , and they said , <unk> , and we have a lot of the open source , which is open-source , and then they &apos;re available from open-source , so they &apos;ve got this device , and they &apos;re actually getting the cheapest <unk> from these tools around the world .
i think somehow that six billion dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a context where it becomes very flexible .
so , i think , in my opinion , a very <unk> hack .
and one of the things i &apos;d recently launched was building a bomb platform .
<unk> , yes , like this kind of <unk> , they &apos;re doing something like this , two inches or whatever .
so you put aluminum <unk> on <unk> and the <unk> into these panels , and then i then snapping them up on <unk> , and then they put that light on that way .
so the device you see there , that doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype so that it &apos;s kind of like my prototype , but it has looked pretty wild , so on top of it , put on electronics on it , and it was the pressure being too high , that thing has gone .
and then i took a computer scan and put it on it .
so if you &apos;re carrying the full power of water with water , the enough pressure of pressure , so i think it &apos;s kind of like 40 to <unk> out of it .
and so then you can draw the particles strong enough , and then they &apos;re going to go into the same with the other .
and the commercial device costs about 50 euros or whatever , or something , <unk> is about 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , that &apos;s right now at the moment that the staircase is going to increase the type of technology , and also reducing the power of technology and dramatically realizing that more people can get engaged in there .
because , as it said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively basic idea about it , and also no chance to make it really well .
because if you &apos;re reading about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself once or saw it .
and i think technology is becoming increasingly important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make meaningful decisions in society , if you want to make reasonable decisions in society , you might need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to make it and understand it , to make it understand .
and then , through the most <unk> , the most open legislation and the citizen science .
so , you &apos;re being asked as citizens into the situation with these kinds of technology through these sorts of technologies .
and this is the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who put themselves on at least publicly on the website , <unk> website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is also that they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s where there &apos;s less people than there are less people in there than actually exist .
so i don &apos;t know about some people who don &apos;t have them .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and partly with these <unk> , they put together in these places .
and this is actually in the beginning .
as i said , <unk> started it first .
and then <unk> , <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is actually a gigantic mesh network of very good , yes , <unk> , who are represented across the world .
and of course , we hope that we &apos;re also more likely to engage in , and then we &apos;re also similarly to normal , so that people can be engaged more people either .
and i would welcome everyone once to try and look at this and try and even himself .
now , it &apos;s not too simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there too far .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , everyone .
so how do we actually work people ?
so this is a question that really moves me as a designer , but also in the field of <unk> , and particularly in the field of <unk> , and all sorts of stuff in the area .
and it &apos;s about how you walk people into interactive media companies to use these interactive media tools so you can use that interactive media and you create a very expensive experience .
so , i believe that the interactive media in us <unk> , cognitive models , so paradigm , which paradigm in our biological memory , a very long time ago , and that we can actually generate them through interactive media .
and this is very intriguing because you actually think that these <unk> , which you get into the future , which is actually going to get into the future , but actually it is so that the future is true with us , with our very basic roots .
what are actually <unk> models now ?
i sat down four main bills , and i &apos;d like to write a little bit about it .
highly cognitive models , and that is the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
among these <unk> models , we &apos;re stockpiling that we have naturally natural relationship with virtuality .
and that actually sounds unusual about them in principle .
but i &apos;m going to look at it in the same way , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying to determine that natural relationship with virtuality .
the second aspect is that we haven &apos;t been able to actually talk about these <unk> models , which is really able to talk very , very , very scary , though we use these days of language .
and the third area , which explains itself from itself .
we all know that an interactive media is by definition of definition , which includes the slaughter level of linearity , and of course , what we say is that we are experiencing the linearity now as normal .
the fourth item is that the story is a place for us .
now , what &apos;s done with virtuality is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you that i like to prove .
how many doors does the house in which they live ?
so that we can &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , but it &apos;s going to happen now , and it &apos;s going on right now .
they go in the spirit of this house , in <unk> them , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> reality , and it &apos;s totally without computers .
fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
and so , for example , we &apos;re struggling for the virtual reality , for example , to describe virtual reality in our online reality , which we can actually do all the time .
and this adds up to <unk> virtual reality , which people used to have in the very pre-industrial while also , because they had no choice at the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing at all .
they didn &apos;t have a books .
or they didn &apos;t have no <unk> lids .
they had no mass mass media .
the only thing they had had was their head .
and in that mind , the memory was happening .
in this mind , g.m. knowledge and using these virtual images , imagination , imagination was being passed as well .
and so it &apos;s also very strong within us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing is , if i &apos;m going to make a little trip here .
yeah , this is .
the interesting thing is , at that time , that was the same time of the person at the same time and the medium themselves .
now , if you think a bit farther .
what are today media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that in the same way .
and as a result of the <unk> , has been known since the history of history .
<unk> , preacher , so-called <unk> , goods were extra , they were extra jerk to keep knowledge in stories .
and even today , we still owe very , very strong stories .
and the author of the book is the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , followed by <unk> , every year , every year for stories .
so this means for a child who has spent most of his life on the <unk> of his life with stories of stories .
now we think our love with stories is based on us as a child on our parents of our parents .
no , no , really missing .
that &apos;s much further back in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as special as it is , that we have translated from facebook in our biological memory , the ability to think <unk> .
i &apos;ve brought you with one example from the northern tribe of the <unk> tribe .
and the british lived in the coastal quadrant of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very aggressive area , and you kind of have to navigate it somehow from island to island to forming food .
and they did what they did with so-called so-called bioluminescence .
you might even know if you &apos;re a little bit interested in it , by australian countries .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have disposable models , but they &apos;ve been used as <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the freedom and the landscape of regions could be mapped through songs of songs .
which was the language <unk> by <unk> .
that is , you know , you &apos;re breathing conversations with rhythm and about rhythm .
and these <unk> , and this rhythm , geology , the carpenters of one region , which has , of course , has been able to make those songs and others together and move back to the left , after the left , to move back to the <unk> .
why do we not sing more to the top from a place to b b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what is actually going on there ?
what happens is that this is the kind of <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve talked about augmenting what we &apos;ve done in these days .
it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and who has changed our interactions of our individual experiences on external media .
on the book and on the image .
and so , unfortunately , we ended up advising god a lump of god .
virtuality has suddenly become strangers to us , and he has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a known professor at the <unk> , is so far from saying that mass media , he says the book , and the picture , so on tv and so on , and so on , what we call as mass media today , that mass mass of our memories have fossilized and <unk> our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the baby machine .
what does depend on our minds and our faith in our bodies ?
and then , the <unk> forces of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they have been more <unk> throughout the year of the year and more <unk> through the forces of the <unk> .
so , instead of seeing individually , we have standardized , very common , with vast common patterns of memories that we can hang out of our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more even more than ourselves .
we have an abstract language of language .
we don &apos;t face the thing anymore in images , not in images , but we mashed them with our language .
we &apos;ve used to begin with things that things happen .
and we &apos;ve embraced the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like for example .
what we stayed with is the <unk> .
still , we have the training system as <unk> very , very strong .
the question is , what is coming right now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , and we had the baby boomers , and we &apos;re now going to go into something called <unk> .
so this sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , which gives us these kinds of ways to explore our capabilities again again .
it &apos;s about virtuality ; it &apos;s about <unk> ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
so , i want to talk a little bit about a little bit .
there are technical concepts like , for example , the augmented reality of reality , which is called the distributed reality .
so if you look at google <unk> , for example , this idea of what makes us combine to combine the virtual world with the real world , which is called the <unk> as something normal , which is to think about it .
another example is what is called virtual reality .
so , of course , in my talk , of course , in the context of my talk , which is where we &apos;re moving towards <unk> , virtual worlds , <unk> worlds model .
and other other examples are the gateway , intelligent systems .
these are the spaces that are being able to respond to people .
and this is the ability , our basic ability , our basic ability to accept virtuality than a real habitat .
i &apos;m in graduate , and i hope the video , which is a very , very beautiful project , brought along the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and these two <unk> are here today .
maybe you &apos;re going to step up at that moment , so you can talk yourself about the two about the bmw .
and this project , as example , i have brought myself back to this cognitive cognitive cognitive models .
so this is a game , i have to say that .
which of course , of course , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , they have very likely to look at people in front of people with some basic <unk> or they used to play with some kind of <unk> in the hand .
anyway , you &apos;re doing that in there .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i think the world is going to discover , so i &apos;m going to discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry i need to be so strong .
you can &apos;t tell them a lot better than that , there &apos;s more much more than that .
and this is what i &apos;m going to discover is that i &apos;m going to discover a city , which is positive or <unk> .
so , from the city of view , i get from a totally different sense of view , which is what i see color and positive zones of cities , and i get totally different , virtual landscape from a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re like to look at .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at right now .
obviously , this virtual world in the walls of our towns , is clear .
and with a kind of a visualization , we can see these virtual worlds visible .
so , what i &apos;d like to do is to wrap my talk , in the sense that the traits and the abilities that we have acquired the <unk> , and we have a little bit of evolution in the machines that are going to be combined with the so-called complex societies , new products , in fact , not into the future .
thank you very much .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to talk about them .
i &apos;m just asked if this bag is there &apos;s a bag of bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
that won &apos;t be done .
i &apos;m also going to go into the same boat , which is in there .
but i &apos;m only going to do it just in an n little bit .
yeah , children are inherently curious about nature or should be curious designers .
so , i &apos;m <unk> from the house of house , which is , of course , in the middle of the curiosity , and what &apos;s changed again is our thinking , and why don &apos;t we restore curiosity and have to redefine &apos; s again , and so on .
this is a whole host of things that you &apos;re looking at beyond the actual existence of a change .
when professors are being shy , they &apos;re going to go naturally into an n of <unk> .
and this is also what i did in the last half-century .
a <unk> on the theme of natural user interface for the natural user .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why don &apos;t you start all the way up with that natural , <unk> <unk> of communication interactions , interactions of communications , interactions and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , because things are always more intuitive , more natural , and you have to look at them , which is more natural or intuitively .
and in front of the context , i put myself in the field of natural user interface , which is the next generation in a human being in the relationship with human computers trying to convert our tools or like themselves to the computer .
so i engaged myself when , of course , what is natural or intuitively .
maybe even have a look at a view of it .
why does it happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , this is short , we &apos;re moving now from the third in the fourth <unk> , or <unk> .
so from modern to <unk> .
every society is shaped by a society .
at the beginning of the language , <unk> <unk> through the language .
so that means you &apos;ve talked a common language , so you can interact with each other with each other , put in the same cave or in other parts , has created cities , or you &apos;ve created so much more deeply .
but the <unk> , though , was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
so , you also need to learn from nature , which is not a creature in nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and of course , in case of course .
this has been obtained by ancient societies and the first form of abstraction .
and that was a field back then because of course , because of course , the living language started <unk> in the form of font , which is called , which is what <unk> and alive is , start , and i <unk> it in stone , and i <unk> it .
depending on the end of me , and whenever i duck down , obviously , obviously there &apos;s a whole lot of other narrative than there is a life of life .
but then <unk> , and then <unk> , <unk> , got started .
then next generation , which we actually ended up living in a lot of life today .
this is the pressure by pressure and <unk> <unk> font with <unk> and others .
at the same time , there was also a <unk> , where <unk> , <unk> , and others have said , &quot; are you supposed to be crazy when the people started to read , and then , of course , they &apos;re totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting generation , and the exciting thing is , there &apos;s only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really involved in this stage at this point of view that we &apos;re involved in .
and of course , that confused us , because we see on one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so forth .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is about the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the old way , you don &apos;t say that in the <unk> mode and no text or other phenomena , which is , i &apos;m going to just buy that moment .
and these two worlds pop right up there , new and old thinking .
and the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these new societies , <unk> a lot of mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from <unk> .
now , not anymore at the local level , but on a global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is globally .
that &apos;s a global ecology on ecology .
not if i think local <unk> , and the neighbor thinks less , it won &apos;t work .
so , from local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , as well , but the total transparency .
so as you knew at the time in the village , who &apos;s what happens to whom and when , of course , this is happening today about this extension of our own selves through these mobile phones on a global level .
it &apos;s that we know , globally , and we &apos;re getting more and more and more and more and more and more common .
so , as it happened earlier in the village , it happened in the village .
so , in front of the context , i &apos;m just trying to look at what &apos;s meant for us , which is , of course , what is natural for us , what is the hell of us , what is the difference ?
because unfortunately , because they get people , they can &apos;t make it <unk> , so they can &apos;t get everybody with it .
so you have to look at what does mean , because it doesn &apos;t just change it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s also going to make it better .
and then , of course , there &apos;s something intuitive , and as a result , as a designer , and i can use a lot of things to make the things that are so intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because then they &apos;re doing fun and they &apos;re doing fun using it .
you &apos;re also engaged in the same as a student , with the subject of perception and <unk> .
and this is also , of course , where you then start and watch out loud and say , ok , i just look into the inner self .
and what does it really look like in there ?
so how do we work when we put up there ?
and what does , of course , because of course , intuitively , and how do we change our channels of perception , and how does the cognitive function work ?
because steve jobs used to say to you , you know , <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , it <unk> it .
so , you really have to look at the details when i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is called the core .
and what you &apos;re looking at is that you have a lot of our seven senses , which is , you know , seven years ago , it comes out in the near future , and surely , in the near future , you add up to the next , you know , and as an extension of our own selves .
and watching , how do we process information , how do we use information ?
in closing , what is because information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
well , many use of the word , don &apos;t even know what it ends then .
but i have to understand in the core core , where it &apos;s going to understand whenever information becomes information from data , from information to information , so i know how to make things as well as possible , to make things computable , to naturally intuitive things .
and of course , what puts creation is based on perception .
so , what we see here is when i &apos;m designing things , like on the right side of the right , where i don &apos;t know , which is salt and pepper , or i can make them computable , by showing things .
so much natural on a gourd , but i see myself directly ; where is salt and pepper in there .
and if i say to someone , you give me some salt or pepper , and then he &apos;s going to start thinking about where is what &apos;s in place .
and on the left just intuitive access , and then hopefully i hope that there is no sugar in there that salt salt will just give you a bit of sugar .
but also our notion of self , how do you configure us too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , though , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s equal to the same size , and yet , our perceptions , depending on what the context is in the context of things .
anyone know what this is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> might work .
there &apos;s going to be more of my glasses on my glasses .
so it &apos;s an n circle .
so , a second circle starts to integrate some resemblance to the resemblance or associate .
and then , again , when i go down a <unk> <unk> , we don &apos;t see each other one , which is circle , namely circle , and yet we see one oneness , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
this is what they call <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , which affects us also in mind .
for the designers , they usually have the first semester in the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the continuity and so forth .
but in the third , high-speed , again , forget about the third .
but that &apos;s essential to create an important point where you want things to make things equally intuitively .
next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is this vision of vision .
now , obviously , it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very interesting when you &apos;re dealing with it .
so , we have the eyes of the eyes , and now think about it , we see from the beginning to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
they &apos;re looking at back from behind at the beginning .
namely , they &apos;re <unk> at the beginning that they see something that they recognize , <unk> circle , and they &apos;re seeing what they recognize , <unk> circle .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at first , before we see it , before we see it , back in our <unk> , to say , to say , &quot; okay . &quot;
so , i have some cognitive <unk> , you know what <unk> , what you want to see .
and then it comes back then , and then comes back again .
again , it goes back to the front , because it doesn &apos;t look at the back in the back , and say , look at it , look at what you see , what you &apos;re seeing is that what you &apos;re seeing is that what you &apos;re seeing is that what you &apos;re seeing is that what you want to see .
and then again , it goes back to the back , and then it turns out it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very reactive process , like some things are going on , and what parts of these things are going to happen .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s heard of this picture .
what happens is exactly what i just described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see anyone out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who ant sees .
does someone see something ?
a <unk> , exactly .
once i saw that , you know that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and further , now you &apos;re always going to see him .
so , in fact , i actually hated them out in <unk> , that they don &apos;t know anymore anymore , but i &apos;ve got them in a very short period of time seeing this dog in a very short way of seeing this dog in this fuzzy picture .
and this is this projection by vision , <unk> , see .
now , i know it &apos;s now , and now i &apos;m going to try to see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very , very exciting processes , which then , in this , right , you &apos;re actually not really cool , but there &apos;s actually a lot in this fundamental mass there &apos;s going on there .
does anyone know what three seconds ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know , as a designer .
now , if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of slipped from the present into the present , i can also bridge the <unk> <unk> , i can only bridge him by doing three seconds .
it has to process it only more than present .
then it moves into the past , and therefore , i can draw very gracefully from the past , for example , when i &apos;m conscious of this phenomenon .
what do you care about ?
yeah , milliseconds .
also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love with you .
that means that if you know that , you know , if you look at it , you pay me to look at who you like a long time , because i don &apos;t consider any <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the view of most of the information we have .
so , this is what the first impressions is going on in a rapidly quick quick speed of how we view things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking for , and how we &apos;re kind of shining against our environment , we can also think about that .
and of course , the designers don &apos;t only deal with the subject of information , neural pathways , or <unk> , but naturally , with the subject of <unk> .
so , a human being with some kind of stuff .
so , there &apos;s even <unk> the practical functions , so dashboards different parts of it .
there is <unk> , where i know exactly where i really need to grab .
but there are symbolic functions , why have someone got a little <unk> , where there &apos;s no such thing as <unk> , so <unk> sums of money on money , so even though it &apos;s not so good yet ?
there we tend to be on the <unk> , on the <unk> that we deal with , of course , as a designer , of course .
back to my real theme of natural user interface and the theme , of course , including <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> &apos;s always , how can i reach very rapidly achieving a particular goal , or as a user interface in a particular way , as well as a user outcome , efficient and <unk> is achieving a goal .
it &apos;s more like the norm .
how can i do something more intuitive ?
i can use that directly , or i need an n manual manual manual , i can do some trained training for it .
and less <unk> , or <unk> , is it .
i &apos;m doing it only differently and beautiful thing , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better <unk> .
you need to understand it also .
and then if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;re looking at , and then you &apos;re going to see why <unk> percent of our stuff in our software isn &apos;t too utilitarian or <unk> , including <unk> in many parts or <unk> , even though it &apos;s already more intuitive to be more than classical software .
and there &apos;s intuitive <unk> isn &apos;t just about apple <unk> , <unk> elementary reality , if i &apos;m going to use technology to make people useful .
why ?
because , by the way , we usually push through this new type of <unk> , which is the natural user , for example , five times faster , on average on our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something about classical <unk> , you need to do something about it , five hours and with this new kind of natural software just for another kind of natural software .
that does not mean they &apos;re probably going to go home four hours to go home , but her company , or something , is going to take you through the four hours .
but what i want to say is , naturally , for us , is one of the things that we do , naturally <unk> things .
and then if we &apos;re going to go back into the field of software , this is the first <unk> interface , which is very abstract , where it took months to cope with those systems .
and then the next thing you would have done with a statistical model or mental model , like the software companies , they have worked , and they have a notion of something called the metaphor , the metaphor , the metaphor of one desktop to create the computer .
so not zeros and zeros , or <unk> codes , but it &apos;s a metaphor .
it has a lot of crafty stuff , but it &apos;s still a lot better off of course too .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> has done a lot more with behavior .
so what i &apos;m doing is , as a vending hand , a lot more often behave than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that i once once said that these are always going to be a viable formula for success , just going to be going to be an application .
and then , if i &apos;m going to take a step into this natural user interface , where i mixed with voice , by speech , by gesture , by gesture , by gesture , and not more by mouse and <unk> .
but that leads me to the point when things are going to make things more intuitive .
so , if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to look back into my little friend here and look at my little friend here , and look , what does that mean ?
and it &apos;s always kind of intuitive for us humans , whenever i have to think very little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think about it , but it really wants to do it .
the smaller i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does it mean for the designers ?
so , if we can look at that , if we look at the existing metaphor from one thing , for example , the metaphor , for example , can i used to use it as a metaphor .
so , i can just propose this , which is a intuitive , from human gatekeepers to software and use software to make the software a lot .
now , of course , the question is , what is the causal <unk> of human beings , and now i &apos;m going to tell you about it .
this is what congestion pricing call .
it &apos;s based on each of us and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that makes everybody of you all the time , but it &apos;s kind of doing it , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or intuitively , or whatever .
the model is going on in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s done by young and old , and it &apos;s being used by us all the time , except that the model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to go about 50 to <unk> times from us to activity in their mind , so , in fact , you realize that it will become fewer common more often than the day .
now , i can just get this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> into a <unk> system .
and through this kind of transmission , rather like the metaphor of the <unk> metaphor , but no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a color projector , a metaphor .
and this is on a higher grail of the <unk> dynasty when it &apos;s linked to the transmission of an classical metaphor , which is the <unk> metaphor .
and so , for example , in which i &apos;m talking about , for example , in <unk> , <unk> as a choice , inform me in the details , i can look at the details , i can look at it in the details , and i can buy it somewhere else .
then i can get the entire transmit .
i try to do that by a <unk> .
you &apos;ve only ruined cake of cake .
ck : now i used to interact with the object , again , <unk> , <unk> .
i think the whole thing , can now be able to filter this , can now say , &quot; show me all of the thing about chocolate for chocolate for example .
and once again , a interface which is more intuitive and very much more natural .
because , because i can grab things like the bottom line , and you can come up with me , is far more natural than if over <unk> organized web websites or other processes to make things accessible .
so imagination is more <unk> <unk> , and with this phrase i &apos;d like to close with , and to say , designers don &apos;t need to think differently , to come up with new solutions , and in that spirit , thank you very much for your attention and please .
so i &apos;m going to give you a whole particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing , if you &apos;re going to grow as a child , as a baby , is that they take care of what they have , yes ? and depending on whether their parents have allowed them to play more or less in the sky , and they will , the more , you know , their curiosity , of course .
and the curiosity won &apos;t learn .
so these are all the people who are here and they &apos;re curious , in fact , people who have a property that they cannot learn .
now , i &apos;m talking about it , basically , these whole <unk> , <unk> , <unk> years of <unk> , in quality of it .
and there is a central point there .
and it depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
they spend + they give them + they discount about two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to add two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to extract two grams from each day .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
you cannot store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only run by the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we actually did not take a phosphorus sample , and we did not take a phosphorus .
so , remarkably , it &apos;s like we &apos;re dealing with something here , which is actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not that way .
because everyone talk about energy , but no one talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is a lot more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only done for two years of phosphorus , and we have a lot more uranium from the world labs around the world than being used in all forms .
just in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium has been distributed to our fields in germany .
and this is what we &apos;re looking at .
it makes leukemia leukemia with children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re slightly less harmful .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , get paid less car .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
and that is no longer protect .
this is what i would like when i would say , <unk> your child , hit three times instead of times five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think from the bottom-up stages , we will think of our entire planet , or later our our entire planet , or later a <unk> .
it &apos;s just about thinking about rewards to think about the <unk> .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil , first of all .
there &apos;s over 60 percent of the water stored stored .
right now , corn is about , we &apos;re going to buy corn and 30 pounds of 30 pounds per hectare per hectare per square meter , or on the square meter of carbon dioxide per hectare , or on the square meter .
that means , we lose in the ground about five times five times more than <unk> .
obviously , we can look at the fossil record .
and everything is flat or content .
in <unk> , for example , <unk> twenty percent of the <unk> framed now .
and because we grow older , they will grow <unk> .
so , this is what they &apos;re all kind of in the <unk> .
yes ?
one baby takes about six <unk> <unk> .
we could naturally reduce ten percent , of course , but what does it do ?
that &apos;s going to work in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with this <unk> ?
here &apos;s one of the most successful men who are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be driven by the pigs on the pigs .
people with the urine at the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because this is what it is about , right ?
well , traditionally , we think we &apos;re in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you look at people when you think about it , if you say , you know , you &apos;re better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you wouldn &apos;t be there , and they &apos;re hostile and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there is nothing <unk> when the human population is to stabilize human population .
in israel , you say , when you carve a dead people , you &apos;re going to <unk> the earth .
here it says , the more you express , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then they drop four times more than we do people .
i might also take out termites , but in the united states , no one of the likes of termites , in that way , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that is , the ants drop much more than we do .
and because they work on a lot harder than we do , and because they only live three to six months , they &apos;re equivalent in their weight , in terms of energy use , they &apos;re doing something 30 billion people .
that is , we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yeah ?
and where you see how far away from it , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are going to be on the planet , can you see that , for example , a program has a program to come up with twenty times , right ?
you can only be <unk> if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree seeing a tree tree ?
yes ?
one one ?
so , that means , all of our intelligence is that we want to be left as a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
luckily , isn &apos;t it , yes ?
there isn &apos;t a gypsum belt of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the world alone six billion trees alone .
you &apos;ve heard a little bit about <unk> from trees ?
that means , all of our intelligence means that we want to be left as a trees .
and , as you see , even with something like demeter , <unk> <unk> , strangely enough agriculture , is not going to suggest that our own <unk> go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really wants to go back into reverse .
and that &apos;s where we are too many .
just about that .
so this is what we feel guilty about on the planet that we say , there is no <unk> , no <unk> , no secrecy , and like they &apos;re all the name that we &apos;re going to do .
isn &apos;t that sad sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful to be less harmful .
but where are we useful ?
we try to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about minimizing a big footprint , which is useful .
we want to be well good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it is not to be there , yes ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have input seals if they &apos;re not there .
and even if you were shooting yourself now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve it .
we can &apos;t do it differently .
we can get our food waste .
we do in brazil in brazil where we get the nutrients from where we get the nutrients .
very directly , we can look at this kind of diet and form of food in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take right off the trash of it .
in china , one of the <unk> is still <unk> today , so , you know ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb , our nutrient supply .
that is , throughout the western <unk> , the entire western <unk> has taken place , but it has never been done by the farmers .
by raising cities , they had to grow progressively more , because farmers were going to go into towns and towns and towns always had to bring their nutrients more .
because of all the western empires , they have always expanding <unk> , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yeah ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done most ancient civilization for five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to calculate the nutrient supply .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat for food in china , you &apos;d expect it to be as long as you &apos;re going to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> to take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat them for food , not for the <unk> .
so , you can see , you can see on the internet , you can see the nutrients .
actually , if you &apos;re able to do this , so , if you &apos;re able to do it , which is producing manure , on a hectare of five or five thousand people in favelas , for example , a farmer for about four and vegetables and vegetables and fish and fish and fish .
and what &apos;s great about it is that the <unk> in the favelas comes back about three percent in the favelas of about three percent .
so , we don &apos;t have to control people , so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> .
we can encourage them to be good .
this is natural <unk> , but the plants are carrying themselves themselves .
the oil is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the way through the design that a farmer can just manage them .
so , this is going to go back the <unk> .
and none of those facilities , we &apos;ve now built over <unk> , in the last 20 years , none of these plants have ever been <unk> .
they could be easily ruined by a liter of <unk> , and then they would be ruined for years .
no doubt .
that is , we don &apos;t need people to control the people in the same way .
we can support them to be good .
that is , we have to add phosphorus tools .
and by the way , by the way , if you &apos;re trying to do what you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re writing yourself in germany , in germany , in the <unk> of all wastewater treatment .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but perhaps they can help the <unk> a little bit of help .
because the <unk> therapy could be obtained by the phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s absolutely successful .
we &apos;ve been used in holland over three years now .
the top government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is something called phosphorus .
but we need a total overall .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling nearly 70 percent of the united states around the world .
there &apos;s an old pile of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries that control 40 percent of roads control .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy sources .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace phosphorus .
it &apos;s not about trying to make the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about to make something true .
and especially of course , first of all , what is the right thing .
that means efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , it is easier because in holland , because in holland , the country is building on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for instance , if you look sad your wife , if you look at them , they come with 50 &apos;s roses .
very inefficient .
but actually , really effective , yes ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany eat about six <unk> of three pounds during their lifetime .
it &apos;s done .
this is not directly accurate because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going on .
but one <unk> , even with that light , i can tell you , is very inefficient , but very , very effective , yes , really effective , yes ?
everything in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not going to make the <unk> a little bit better , and put it in <unk> , and it &apos;s going to lose the entire materials for the motor , but first to ask , how do you bring those circuits ?
imagine mozart &apos;s efficient .
yeah ?
and when i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , eh ?
it &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t it efficient .
if you &apos;re in love with someone , is efficient ?
yes ?
so , everything in life is counting down , isn &apos;t it about stopping , eliminating , reducing , reducing .
all the <unk> .
we tell people , oh yes , you &apos;ve got no green green in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right , yes ?
in every place , where you get <unk> , you get <unk> <unk> .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things wrong , you have a thali .
as we think north , as we think north .
there &apos;s every footprint .
when they walk , yes , everybody &apos;s breaking the floor .
because the bottom is going to die , and the mosses will die from , and the water is washing off the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water stays longer in the grassland .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is a marsh .
not <unk> .
we say in germany sustainability .
yeah ?
but if i ask her question , how do you deal with her wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s actually the minimum limit .
so not saving , prevent , prevent .
every waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s kind of like when you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , like the people in the high bow .
because , you know , that &apos;s a mechanical process .
it &apos;s a form of <unk> , yeah ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we designed for example , for example , developed a <unk> liquid , which is at temperature temperature .
they can pinpoint them where they are going to go and stand .
in two ways , you &apos;re building it all anywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants , so they &apos;re wiping out from biodiversity for biodiversity .
that means , we &apos;re useful , not less environmental .
so there are two loops .
not all of them will be <unk> .
a tv or a washing machine , they &apos;re using it only , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , they need to go to biological systems .
things that will only be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking only about the biological systems .
yeah ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
entirely direct advertising , not for the company <unk> by <unk> , but for doing this , they now help this business company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things anymore , we don &apos;t do things anymore .
yes ?
so , if i go to dinner and say , this is free from <unk> , and then they &apos;re useful at all .
no , we lay out what &apos;s in there .
positive positive .
so not like <unk> .
not toxic in .
it &apos;s useful in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes they &apos;re able to do with <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> can go into biological stores , right ?
everything about it is <unk> from it .
and of course , if we succeed , obviously , of course , for nike , for nike , for the textile industry and the textile industry and the whole textile industry with the textile industry and the textile industry and the textile industry .
and this is half of all the <unk> around the world that causes the textile industry in the textile industry .
so they help you with , you know , you ask people to do it .
<unk> , <unk> , power is really serious ?
because these have been changed twice the limiting again .
and i &apos;m not really sure if they really <unk> it .
so , help me do a little bit of this .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been present .
that &apos;s going on .
so , we can make things like this , if they bounce off , if they come out , they can &apos;t biological biological loops .
the engineering system is the same .
there &apos;s a direct pulse for this .
this is the first environmental backpack , in fact , that it &apos;s done to go back into the cycle .
so that , in each store , you can <unk> the things .
if you come on , yes ?
remember the <unk> again ?
at the moment , the trash .
these <unk> <unk> , almost .
in the countries where people come to money , where people come to money .
there &apos;s been on the front door , but it &apos;s still in the landscape , but it &apos;s still in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so then it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside , you can only go back to <unk> , you can plant with a baby in israel or in tunisia , with a baby in israel .
yeah ?
just taking those <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and grabbing the powder to plant around with plant trees .
that &apos;s the baby <unk> for the entire life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so .
yeah ?
we can do that .
we can still redefine everything else .
i started a institute on a institute .
meanwhile , there &apos;s a lot of people talking about , and you can all get involved .
there &apos;s extra dimensions of it , <unk> , where everyone can get involved .
so not saving , tax , avoid , reducing , not a noun , but intelligent waste .
do you make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i was writing myself as <unk> , as <unk> as <unk> , so in english , i understand .
<unk> are the performing notes in <unk> music .
so if you don &apos;t want words to propagate the text in another language , but you have to understand the deeper meaning of words and inferiority , in order to make a conscious translation translation , everyone knows that it has to do with self-reflection .
in fact , from the german into english , translated into english , you can have more knowledge , because if you &apos;re writing poetry or all about poetry .
it &apos;s kind of irrelevant what we do with our <unk> musicians doing what we do with our <unk> .
so , as a footnote panel , i have just the written of the written notes .
you &apos;ll surely think that it has <unk> in the notes exactly everything that he &apos;s imagined in the notes of what he &apos;s imagined .
in reality , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are also about equivalently , or <unk> , as a verbal language , articulating shape of a landscape .
because in the <unk> <unk> , the smell of the flowers don &apos;t smell , the degrees of the <unk> is just to highlight the level from the <unk> , not feeling .
this is , the <unk> needs to combine these <unk> data , in another , which is translated , into another , which is specific , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so today , i &apos;d like to share with you what i &apos;m going to translate into language , which is translated , even into verbal language .
so basically , translation translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do it in german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to translation translation translation in translation translation .
so , the music is kind of like the spoken language for me as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes in the same bit about the letters of a writing .
so it won &apos;t do just learning grades , and they &apos;re not going to memorize notes on the piano or right at the same time .
so , these are just the letters that you have learned to paint .
so the letters of the letters you don &apos;t recognize when you can do the language .
so you end up with the learning process of music for at least as the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the cassowary , but only passively understand , or you can also talk to the musical speaker until the musical speaker .
the work of <unk> starts <unk> like the one of the <unk> .
after you first selected a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you end up looking at the emergence of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the chain .
you read in the letters , <unk> notes , notes , or if there are words , thoughts from the composer themselves .
you studied the works that it &apos;s composed and later on .
you &apos;re settlements .
the <unk> , writing it .
what does it feel like ?
what were his lives like , what are the society and politics ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m interested in .
you think of yourself in those days , looking for contemporary images , looking at a contemporary image of it .
however , you know , as an official thing , you know , as an official empire , by the kind of simplicity you &apos;re playing with , and there &apos;s always going to be a lot easier to feel into it .
and it turns out there &apos;s always a lot more to the friend that you &apos;re living with .
his cause to write the piece , becomes increasingly more and more useful to play with my personal cause of play .
now , the notes from the book as a <unk> record of the message from the message of the composer , but just a framework , i turn into this framework to make sense of meaning .
i &apos;m going to talk about my own words , which is what on this framework .
i &apos;m going to finish up what those notes might mean .
now , for me and for the composers and what they might mean for him today , and what they could now mean for him today .
every calorie , every phrase gives me a sense of meaning , because i think it comes from my own , because it comes from my own personal <unk> .
it &apos;s got to be <unk> for me in here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that my kingdom is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i have allowed to have the experience , the piece that i have done so long in advance how to see new ways of seeing .
as you have watched a happy new day , despite the same rituals of life , getting up with the same rituals of life , up with the work , so i can always keep the same component again .
i have become older again , seasons changing , my pulse rate ends slower slower than the morning , in the morning , it takes longer to come back to conquer the sound again than at home again .
i take the breath of the audience , consciously consciously , or subconsciously .
and this influenced me and influenced it as much as my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also very wonderful , though i &apos;m standing with a cushioned level on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing is happening in a good , <unk> conversation .
you get into a new idea , and immediately gets this answered with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen to be things that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do with that .
it &apos;s great fun to make music , and they have seen as the audience feel alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that , like that moment .
i cannot play as play as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to go through my palette of the <unk> dynasty , emotion and emotion as well as you have today .
sure , i &apos;m also going to have some <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to have some new <unk> .
i have a pretty nice example of this .
it was on a saturday morning in my beloved old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a known professor , <unk> and christina professor at <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was too young too young , so he was <unk> when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky , it was very early on , it was very early on , with 13 years , i was in high school on top of college .
i was at the age of 17 when i was attending one of his courses again , and i was told the last four tales by chopin , by chopin .
and he asked me what the introduction of it was for me .
this is a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , &quot; expectation .
there he <unk> , and he meant , so ?
it has to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory .
it was already over <unk> .
well , by 17 , you have dreams , and no significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play the game every couple of years , and it turns out it turns out to me , although no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because every time i read something new .
so , an example from a totally different domain . monet has the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , with <unk> light .
he translated the <unk> , as he saw it , as he saw it , as he saw it in this moment .
his personal <unk> <unk> .
the most fundamental item of a piece is comparable .
by now , i also grew older than chopin when he wrote that piece .
he lived only lived years of lived .
and it &apos;s important for me to look at the notes , even though i &apos;m talking to them .
to keep the <unk> , directly with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when it has already died before it died .
well , how do you begin to talk about the language of music ?
i said , well , you know , you &apos;ve been looking for something like spoken language .
a lot of the time is , you know , you &apos;re learning the notes .
you &apos;re learning basically by reading , until you &apos;re only speaking one word .
you learn the notes on notes on the instrument .
and then , if all your hand in time and right , as it sits in the notes , they come up with notes , they come out as sound sounds like music .
now , when it &apos;s done , student gets the <unk> component .
it doesn &apos;t really talk about rewards in terms of rewards .
well , there &apos;s a little bit on it in front of it , so that &apos;s a fast piece .
<unk> , slow .
loud and <unk> , f and b , etc .
this is what most of us here .
but even when you put this data forward , it still remains something technical .
and yet , it &apos;s still no use .
i wonder myself .
i wonder that you would often forget something very powerfully .
namely that , in order to make music on the instrument , you could do your musical and feel right there .
that &apos;s what they sing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn from sing , because they don &apos;t have the parents , they won &apos;t do it from themselves .
it &apos;s like the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have your own experiences and shape of the music to have another way of the music to make the sound .
people who never sang , have never felt directly with your own body , as it is to make a clay , as it is to make a clay .
another thing to do with his own breath .
the instrument is , namely , the extension of our body .
our vocal chords , our hands and feet to dance .
so , the <unk> in the hallway is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> today with music isn &apos;t <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more music if it &apos;s going to be a boring .
no longer trying to sing a bribe or sing .
each of its own music is <unk> , if you continually <unk> from the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
i don &apos;t think you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think they can &apos;t sing , they can &apos;t sing ?
or b because they don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out if you can &apos;t yet , or learn how to use those little muscles , which are the vocal chords , right ?
so you can actually train them .
or c , because you have <unk> it , you &apos;re <unk> .
there i am , how <unk> competent was this diagnosis ?
have you already got a hint of <unk> or <unk> , like you &apos;re going to put it beautiful today ?
or d , they don &apos;t like any music and they want to have a reason to do nothing with it .
but what i &apos;d like to regret , because music is a beautiful thing , <unk> thing .
but perhaps you can still <unk> them too .
well , you see , in all cases , no one has to be a candidate candidate .
but don &apos;t tell them , i don &apos;t understand any of the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
because i say , but surely you can &apos;t tell them if they like they don &apos;t like it .
because i don &apos;t think it teaches me , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s delicious , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t usually get off to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t need to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously to them , and tell them if they &apos;re delicious or not .
whether the music is too cute or too cute .
tell them what they feel .
with the time you also get standards , you want something more spices , you want to taste some more spices out of it , or taste even more confident about it .
why am i asking myself now from my audience , that it &apos;s also listening to it ?
because the music is language , and there is a language to communicate with language .
a artwork you never look at , doesn &apos;t have a force .
that &apos;s eating by a chef or a chef cook , has to be dinner , and not only looked at or <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
so , please listen to me when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in an environment where the adults are active or at least active music , a kid growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask , to ask , which color does your flower ?
can you play them in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a <unk> , instead of a red one , a blue flower on a blue flower .
and this is quite different than before .
and that was the very first beginning of the very first speech speech .
so the first step is to take on an take .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which is initially written by a hundred or a half ago , or even three hundred years ago ?
in the meantime , the instrumentation have <unk> .
there was no one at the time <unk> as an instrument at all .
it was just not invented yet .
i think the bach would have been enthusiastic , if he had the <unk> <unk> of modern <unk> .
i can now look at the <unk> who used the bach , in the modern wing , for the heath hen , for the heath hen , for the heath hen .
by beethoven , you know that he had heard more than he had been deaf .
today , modern orchestra are able to play everything , which is a orchestra <unk> by those days as <unk> .
and that &apos;s why the composers rely on us <unk> to new designs .
so they &apos;re going up with what they &apos;ve thought about in mind .
and also what they think of themselves in the spirit would think .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what your blood is envy ?
were they used to be <unk> ?
and what did it felt like ?
suck .
i have a friend , who drives a boyfriend .
when i come from my little <unk> w , and i think it comes up with me , is this emotion .
i &apos;m shooting something through your head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need for an n big car ?
that &apos;s already lost half of his value in half of his value .
and anyway , you do work much less than me .
why do i have to afford to do that in an n little car ?
and then i immediately catch a , which is unfair .
it &apos;s justice against justice .
and as i say to the word justice , this uncomfortable emotion is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to make these unpleasant feelings like automobiles .
you can also try that in words like revenge or nostalgia or objects .
so i want to introduce you to this mechanism today or something that you &apos;re probably familiar with today .
the mechanism comes from the <unk> .
but you don &apos;t think about the <unk> , as you may have heard of , when people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then <unk> <unk> , so he gives you the vision of the vision .
on one occasion , you see the liar don &apos;t believe what he says .
it turns out it &apos;s easy to make sure that he has a very different point of view .
he only makes you think of them and not himself .
no , the <unk> i talk about trying to make sense of yourself .
they need to use those <unk> to get a self-deception bar to try and get a self-deception .
they can make it less light , yes , <unk> or falling down .
they need time .
from that time there &apos;s an anecdote that you might recognize .
spanish painter <unk> picasso once a woman once .
and so this woman has been <unk> by her , the portrait wouldn &apos;t look at her .
and picasso , they &apos;re waiting for it .
it &apos;s always more similar to them .
at this point , when you smile , you see how important this ball is and how much time you need to learn something , what artists can say very well to us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship with a <unk> relationship .
the artist share with you something , and especially of this lady , what you don &apos;t see , if you just look in the mirror and look at it in the mirror .
the artist share with you in such a portrait with something that you will only be familiar with , if you look at this artwork again again .
then this uncomfortable feeling disappears , so you wouldn &apos;t look at it periodically , and it will always look like it .
so here you have this mechanism where we can use the mother as a great invention to our <unk> .
and not only in art , in the book , in the mythology , in the mythology , in the mythology , it appeared again .
you might know , perhaps this idea of the lady who looked at every morning in the mirror and wondering who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day says this mirrors , yeah , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much <unk> from this true input from this true inform , also the mirrors can &apos;t grow from this true input .
but we should simply make sure that you can &apos;t say that you can &apos;t tell a woman somewhere else somewhere else .
it &apos;s needed to think of what we &apos;ve done under <unk> <unk> , again .
we need to get at that point of view these days that we can &apos;t even survive .
we don &apos;t just have the art in art , in <unk> , but also in the science of these great lying .
and there &apos;s this story from the wife &apos;s hindquarters of <unk> .
they heard about charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the descent of man .
that &apos;s the human being swallowed by the monkeys , and , yes , there would be a common ancestry between people and monkeys .
and then she raced her husband to her husband and said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles is about .
the person is supposed to be from the monkeys , or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people getting aware of it .
why do we need to recognize people from something when it is true ?
because unless we can &apos;t live those <unk> .
because we &apos;re at self-deception , this sense of being great , from the highest creature , not from one of these things , from something like an organism that exists yet to make a brick , or whatever it exists for us .
so , we cannot respect those things .
we need to recognize people realizing that people are ignorant of things , especially if they &apos;re true .
so you see , as slowly of this mechanism and look like this , and look at the tracks that lead to something different than this magnificent picture of ourselves , i want to suggest that i &apos;m going to give you another story .
one particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me her .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , she &apos;s teacher , and she &apos;s told by a student .
a 16-year-old student team .
they likes to love him because he &apos;s got a tilt for sincerity .
and she asked him , what are your teammates ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m in the fire service .
and because i &apos;m in the fire service , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you feel it when they &apos;re <unk> at that point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever there &apos;s a person in moral , using the <unk> , we should try to replace it with the <unk> , and then we try to replace it with the <unk> .
do you do this , and then you experience the phrase .
though i &apos;m in the fire service , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they sense that the actual reality is behind us .
so a little bit of <unk> , who cares about <unk> .
and they &apos;re interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no freedom to which we can look around , where they &apos;re learning how to make sense of how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second thing , just the fire service .
he signed himself up .
and <unk> , you also don &apos;t want to say that you would like to put molecular smoke somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire came out afterwards .
no , it doesn &apos;t look much better when we show that we are actually going to get rid of the risks that others do just when they lay around a fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
so these <unk> <unk> , at the heart level , knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that he can &apos;t say that .
so here you have this <unk> between the unconscious and the conscious conscious conscious system that you can &apos;t do something about it , and the things you know about it , you know , you can create a lot better for them and others can look better for them and others .
so there are just these words that we used in the language of political speech to the political speech .
actually , we know something else is the case .
but we know when we say , these are the social dilemmas very complicated .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , so it &apos;s impossible to present things in a society that is supposed to work .
now i &apos;m going to talk to you what we found in my institute .
by what logic of those deception , these self-deception , the willingness to see another reality as the ones we know in the unconscious know that it is valid to propagate the outside .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example , what many of you know , and some of them appreciate you , don &apos;t actually need a lot of them at all .
i mean my soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is kind of an intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not about stop <unk> , physical nature is .
and if you have people in front of that , you have a soul , or you can have a soul , or you can also say that it felt so much like the head of the mind , not from matter , and blood , kind of <unk> , on the earth , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yeah .
and from that soul , they think somehow that they kind of think in this darwinian nature , in that <unk> nature , <unk> it in the <unk> , the <unk> , it &apos;s being present in the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then , if these deletions then <unk> about human beings , he &apos;s filled with it , with the spirit , with nature , which can only live , yes , with the soul .
and then he can just <unk> himself .
so this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s associated from the outside to people .
so we want to perceive them as something that is necessarily vital for our lives .
and if you have these condition in front of you , then you understand the logic that we feel about to make a <unk> of our world with a <unk> of our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> device .
<unk> , you know , you &apos;re still going out of school .
so this is a belief here , which is a logic that describes us .
this is the most complex part in my talk .
here you need something logic , but the willingness to lying .
and that &apos;s how they think they can use that logic just to be wrong .
in this prophetic , three sets of sentences .
the first thing is , <unk> says , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if law has right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s one third sentence .
i looked at him in particular .
one third sentence that appears immediately in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
people who don &apos;t have a soul , who is dead , can &apos;t possibly say anything .
and this is where you have it .
here comes this logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
and i can say , because i can say everything .
logic does no statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and when i was right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have a right , you don &apos;t have a man .
logic does not make statement about what is true .
i can say everything i can say .
but critical , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s actually true .
so when <unk> says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now , your conscious conscious minds immediately , you can do something about it .
it &apos;s a third sentence that actually nothing to do with the first two sentences has done , and it &apos;s as though the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and assumed .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic , which is just using those words that two words are accurate , and a third standard that looks like they have to do something with it , so we can save our clitoris .
so , we &apos;re doing as if it is actually impossible without a soul to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can keep these things from different examples .
so in the present , we have a modern modern example , which is filling up again , filling <unk> filling up again .
so , you have to look at another memorable theme , a lot of titles from philosophy , you think .
this has to do that we go back into the 21st century .
there was an scholars who was named johannes <unk> , who was named johannes <unk> , named <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that thrives from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have the soul .
this is so a <unk> .
and if you put those exactly in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , then he <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what kind of haystack he wants to go first .
so he sits right in the middle .
so these are the <unk> presented .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> on each other .
there &apos;s nothing there at all .
so only if you take another example , so if you get a different sort of radical power , you don &apos;t need reason to make sense of reason , and you don &apos;t need reason to do it .
automatically rides walks up to the right ideas .
so , if you have this idea that you somehow get lied into nature , which is going to be driven by the larger load that you put on , and then you also have to feel that there must be something like free will have to give you something like a free will .
and so , if we &apos;re also on <unk> in <unk> , i remember being <unk> in brain imaging .
there &apos;s an scholars , which is called <unk> wolf , and from him , you sometimes say , wolf <unk> , there &apos;s no manual lids .
now we can rebuild the second sentence again , and say , if wolf has dropped right , then they don &apos;t have <unk> .
these sentences are perfectly logical and accurate .
and what we can now read almost a daily daily daily newspaper , find it in this third sentence .
so it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have an ace bandage , can &apos;t lead to its actions and claims for its actions , and it &apos;s therefore <unk> .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
actually , first of all , you would have to prove to see if there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of the deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence is wrong , when you first have to choose the opposite direction .
and now they can just point if they want to make anything , if they wanted anything to test themselves , especially if they want to make people happy to make people feel happy .
so , for example , if you meet a people who you can then say , there are no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word to <unk> , which is called prophet .
you cannot call them , that would be a little <unk> .
tell you , there &apos;s no doubt lids .
immediately , you &apos;ll find one of these things , for which , of course , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove it .
and you have a problem .
because what they &apos;re doing is they can &apos;t prove to them that they can &apos;t prove it , that they don &apos;t have <unk> , is really happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it , because he &apos;s got to deceive them .
because he blogged them at a golf ball on which he himself don &apos;t even himself .
because actually , this man is not really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only been interested in it , <unk> yourself in front of the need to prove to prove that there are <unk> .
so , in the way , in the art of the proton chain , you &apos;re experiencing the brilliance of the connectome .
and once again , they have a way to feel that <unk> in other people , they &apos;re doing it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy , if they don &apos;t remember that way they don &apos;t remember that way .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i was allowed to ask myself if i could mention them , i asked them if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the great <unk> here of this great event and asked me if i wanted to keep this talk here .
i got to say , you &apos;ve got to say , you &apos;ve got to talk , you &apos;ve got really hard to talk about my idea .
and i might think of perhaps my favorite idea that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s obviously the sum entirely , lots of ideas .
and i &apos;m probably one of these nice girls lying there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s counted on , because i started studying engineering research groups in <unk> , technical college , today , you name it , i think , you know .
and i decided in the middle of the &apos; 80s for berlin years , because i wanted to make renewables , and we didn &apos;t want to go into the <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and then they were all <unk> in the back of the <unk> , including the <unk> called <unk> .
the name today is <unk> .
because a good engineer is either great automobile or <unk> .
but it &apos;s kind of <unk> like an n <unk> , from the kind of a hundred watt out of the watt , which was a toy .
and in berlin , it had a <unk> <unk> .
so , i &apos;m grateful for the <unk> grateful that they did <unk> the word again , because they couldn &apos;t use the word anymore , because there was no one on the one hand , because everything on the left was really bad .
in fact , it wasn &apos;t like that in the <unk> years .
and it was just so that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in <unk> , where they were doing evil .
so , in the field of <unk> , but it was called the wind and wind and wind and wind and <unk> , and i started the mid &apos; 80s .
and so , a lot of what was said today , touch me very , because many of the beautiful statements were that i had also been through .
i worked in the <unk> of the <unk> , which was <unk> .
we were used 20 people .
if one has said , it has been <unk> , which has a totally <unk> . i &apos;ve been struggling for about 10 years , so i &apos;ve got a lot of my father thinking about it , because all of my father &apos;s always <unk> him , you &apos;ve got the money window into your child .
it deals with bollocks .
and it was really , really , really , very eagerly , and then you get into something like this , which appeared in a window , where i asked myself , after 10 years , followed by a thousand years ago , which is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , of course , whether it &apos;s really supposed to be the great thing .
and i went out to <unk> <unk> , and then we started with friends , i became institutionalized of the company , and then along with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s greatest <unk> in the world .
a <unk> , but again , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have a small group , we decided we &apos;re going to begin again and go back and look at the next topic of the future , and i think it &apos;s kind of like that again .
and i brought to you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you now .
and the title of speech was , yes , like you get into a hundred percent renewable .
and we &apos;ve just just started to ask with a relatively expensive history of history , where if you could , you know , where you could use a memory of money today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a <unk> peak rate of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
that &apos;s simply technological .
so when they <unk> more <unk> each other , it starts to fail .
i &apos;m always going to tell the politicians , if they invest in <unk> our facility .
and they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t even be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we &apos;ve seen in europe seven percent , and our network is the dark .
if we had 20 percent in europe in europe , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , it was <unk> , the first way to start with the island , first of all , started to calculate .
how big , because they &apos;re actually supposed to be a battery that you have in 20 , 30 , 50 , 50 , 50 , perhaps even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go further again again .
the conventional system does look like this anywhere in the world .
by the way , by the way , one year by a hundred <unk> electrical performance on <unk> <unk> in the world .
it &apos;s like a hundred nuclear power nuclear power plant , because it &apos;s rapidly moving across .
the <unk> of the world , which is going to be deleted by diesel , because you don &apos;t have approved .
this is quick .
you put this kind of big box .
and then it looks like a lot like this .
in fact , three of the <unk> , two are always being waited .
so , one of the things that is the bottom is just the lower .
we also have very accurate data too .
and the <unk> or the <unk> or whatever it is , is usually a self-organizing system or a system or whatever a system in small amounts here .
our goal was to say , &quot; ok . &quot;
the grid gets <unk> , and the wind , sun use , will use the load of the load , that they can map the wider brand .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , you don &apos;t have to turn the petrol off .
that means , in the moment , you have to make sure that the renewables can take away all the web .
of course , you can only , of course , if you &apos;re managed in some kind of a way and managed here .
no one has done this in the world .
so this is in the small style , you can also use your bills in the car , you know a little bit about a small <unk> device .
people always ask me , what do you do because in <unk> ?
that &apos;s already .
but if you want several of these <unk> , and you want to make a web , and that &apos;s going to be very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go up to 70 percent renewable rate , and then there &apos;s still this rest , the last 10 , twenty percent , which is going to be very , very expensive , twenty percent , which is going to work out of batteries .
this is going to be a source of energy , which then , of course , methane , methane , power to gas , you know , that will be it .
they have to go more and more on a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s done with a regular , dysfunctional battery battery battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then they did a whole bunch of simulations .
and they have wind and sun and <unk> , and they came up with the result , which is a very interesting conclusion that , after twenty years , they took a middle <unk> from about 50 cents per hour , about 50 cents per hour , about <unk> cents .
these were the first measured calculations in six years ago .
and then we said , &quot; okay . &quot;
so , is great , then we have a business business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like this , if the average <unk> is going up five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what should everything be done ?
with people negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we were only at the top of it at the first five people in order to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is sort of the traditional system , which green is our system .
so our system also has a disclaimer , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with gasoline , and we &apos;re not going to make a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> in the island , which is what we find is great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the engineering problem .
and so therefore , we decided to build a pavilion in berlin , where we can sort of map the electric <unk> of the island at scale one at the same time .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking for , and then we &apos;re looking for finding the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia in asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , they &apos;re in the &apos; 90s by the bbc , with bbc <unk> , today , has been developed , and then became dwarfed by the japanese .
you can see it , it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
it has a power power , and it can take six hours to do this performance , and it &apos;s the battery that we have sort of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up then .
we also have one of these <unk> units in the same size , which is associated with this , in fact , the largest dynamic behavior on this web , so in the <unk> , it looks like this , because there is the big battery , there is the whole cost of which we &apos;re capable of simulating the web .
over here , again , we simulate the entire chain , the perimeter of cable cable cable , in order to sort of represent the web mapping in the net .
and you can see here again , again .
we also can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
this is what we see here again , again , again , again , here again , again , <unk> <unk> .
and what we did was , since <unk> was completed , the hall is completed , until now , basically , everything from the individual system of electronics in software to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we &apos;re acting as a company , which is only about a company that &apos;s only about the battery and the bottom line and everything between them .
obviously , you have to go to the battery , you have to talk to the battery , you have to go into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
and beauty is on the issue that you &apos;re on in this island , which is basically everything that we &apos;re going to get into solving the problems that we &apos;re going to get when we &apos;re going to increase our consumer from renewable sector .
so this whole discussion of what &apos;s going to go right now and <unk> , <unk> , like this is supposed to go on , for instance , for example , from <unk> to 30 percent , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> , then <unk> <unk> .
so , <unk> , a <unk> anywhere .
so , we can begin to think about the island of integrating <unk> , <unk> , you can manage the burden .
so , if you &apos;re at 2,300 percent renewable , you won &apos;t be able to do that without the <unk> .
you can walk through &apos; n <unk> , you can walk through bed nets , yeah , and you &apos;re going to do it anyway , but you &apos;re never going to conserve in stores .
and that &apos;s kind of an n little bit of the embassy .
so , a lot of people get a lot of people and look at this because you can see what the problems you get .
if we turn it off , you don &apos;t just have that spinning mass , which causes a little bit of a mass in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just taken out of louder rotating pools from great <unk> , wherever the wave across all around europe .
we look in this grid , you see the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to get hotter at decimal point , let &apos;s get a little bit of seaweed again , and then again , we &apos;re going to come up again .
this is the system .
and , of course , this is incredibly inert .
if you put that somewhere down there , it &apos;s worth a while .
the tar sands reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and at that time , they can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that stuff , you have to replace this spinning mass , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can <unk> with this big battery , two milliseconds of time .
and then you see what enormous amounts there is there .
and the message is , we must get rid of this rotating mass <unk> , if we kind of like our goals twenty twenty , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 percent and so on , if we &apos;re going to do it at all .
then we need to break down our <unk> capacity into the net .
<unk> is just going to run the power station at the speed of preserving the frequency .
yeah , it &apos;s a <unk> right now , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going to go .
and what we &apos;re trying to do is just try to convince you that you can break down the pipeline , <unk> , by putting into some electrochemical memory into the net .
so , there are now a lot of studies now .
and at that point , people always come and see , and look at our relationships on the , kind of like our <unk> .
and yeah , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get there a piece of far future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , kind of like the discussion i had in the last 30 years , for the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t there , there &apos;s krill , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve got everything that doesn &apos;t happen .
we have 30 <unk> <unk> deployed today in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i &apos;m just going to go out into the next 30 years , and i &apos;m going to have the same capacity for <unk> stored on the whole world .
it &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of <unk> and arguments .
the beauty is that i have seen in the last two years now , that scientists have seen themselves on my side .
we have now gotten about 10 million <unk> now , and we get about a german company now to <unk> the german web .
this will happen in the next april .
so from that , you also notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only about those <unk> , and the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and then if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a self-organizing system .
so , there &apos;s always been trying to do these <unk> , these <unk> , who are <unk> , they have a very small net net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> nothingness .
however , the question is very simple , if you &apos;re totally independent , by some of the fossil or <unk> <unk> , somewhere around the world will be teaming up somewhere around the world , you &apos;re going to be an island .
then they only use what to get at the sun and the wind where it is where they live .
and that &apos;s kind of a little bit of our vision from a vital energy processor , and i &apos;m also appreciative of the thankful that they have said to use power .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and this is what we &apos;re doing , and this is the talk about <unk> <unk> , that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a <unk> and use power of power , there &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be kind of weird and you can have a vision .
and you really have to remain pretty strict about it , but i think it &apos;s happening .
thanks very much .
when steve lopez , <unk> , the los angeles times , one day from the streets of los angeles , he heard a beautiful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who played on a violin , that had only two strings on a violin , which had only two strings .
many of you will know history , because from <unk> papers on a book later on it later became a book called robert lopez and jamie <unk> as a nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , who studied at the <unk> of his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel <unk> <unk> , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , he spent homeless row on the streets of <unk> row row in the center of los angeles in los angeles .
i encourage you to read <unk> book , or look at the movie , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two superpowers , but as they finally create the instrument , and how they would eventually be the instrument , the <unk> , nathaniel gone off from the streets .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 two years ago , two years ago , in the walt disney hall hall hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine myself .
he was talking in a very conversational and <unk> clay in <unk> ma and hillary clinton and about what the dodgers were going to do in the world , and all the <unk> passage of the first sentence in the last sentence .
and we got to talk to music , and a few days later , i received an email , which was that nathaniel had moved to <unk> with me .
now , i have to mention that nathaniel will reject a medical treatment , because he had been treated with shocks and handcuffed , which is a trauma that he has been following his whole life .
now , as a consequence of this , he finally gets vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages . these are sometimes so bad , and he disappears days of <unk> row in the streets of <unk> row , all of this horror and <unk> of his own mind .
and in the same way that there was nathaniel , when we started with our first class in the walt disney hall , they began to look at this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and worked totally lost in his eyes and totally lost .
he was talking about <unk> demons and smoke and about how someone wanted him to poison someone in their sleep .
i had scared , not <unk> , but i was afraid i could lose him in one of his states , one of his states , and that i could destroy his relationship with the violin , so i started talking about scale and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> .
so i just started playing with play .
i played the first sentence by beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was in mind , i realized that in beck &apos;s eyes was a complete change .
it was as though he was standing under the influence of an invisible drug , which was a chemical response to my game .
<unk> <unk> anger in understanding , into a steady curiosity and grace .
and as a result of a wonder he took his violin , and started playing some little <unk> of <unk> , and then asked me to play them with play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , started by bach by beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that it &apos;s not just a fundamental knowledge of music , but it &apos;s linked to it in a close personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just knows from los angeles in los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , <unk> man who had moved cross-country to los angeles , a <unk> , called <unk> , <unk> , terrific , at <unk> trained musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
by nathaniel , it means music &apos;s emotional health .
because the music allows him , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real creativity .
and so he <unk> his <unk> state .
i understood that exactly the nature of art is .
this is the reason why we make music , which is something we put deep inside of us , our emotions , with our artistic lens through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that speech is reaching us all , and moves inspired to us .
what nathaniel did , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of the music bringing him back into a family of musicians who recognized him who recognized his talent and <unk> .
and i &apos;m always going to talk about nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney disney hall , or <unk> row , it reminds me of why i became a musician .
thanks very much .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert <unk> .
robert # : i want to play something i &apos;d like to take on the <unk> dialectic .
i hope you &apos;ll pardon me .
so i knew a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two loved ones .
that first , it was kind of like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good texture , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what for a fish .
more importantly , it was bred in <unk> <unk> to the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so , you could feel comfortable selling it .
i had a relationship with that beauty over several months .
one day , the company called the company in the company , asked if i could do anything about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this cybersecurity problem was for our cooks , and how do we hold fish for our discharge ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve had the oceans gamma caps like we &apos;ve performed forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to escape the destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish , who we adore , the tunas , the nuts , the <unk> , they &apos;ve collapsed , they &apos;ve collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , i think , <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many of the arguments about it . <unk> <unk> , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , taking green , is a big disadvantage .
he has a grant from 15 to one .
that &apos;s , 15 pounds of <unk> , you need to get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so there was finally a company trying to get it right .
i wanted to deprive her .
day before the event , i called the <unk> boss on the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re being famous for as far as the outside in the sea , that you can &apos;t <unk> the environment . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out there that the waste from our fish is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added to that , &quot; we &apos;re basically a own world .
these <unk> from <unk> to one , he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in business . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one thing ? what do you do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; great , &quot; i said .
and on that evening , i lay in bed thinking , what is the hell is a sustainable dragline ?
so , i &apos;m going to call the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said , he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to grant .
now , i <unk> with a bunch of people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , to the senior biologist .
let him also describe him as well .
&quot; do i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yep , <unk> , skin , <unk> , remains , <unk> and forage . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in terms of perhaps two percent .
&quot; now , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what is sustainable is to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long drop in the leadership and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m dragging myself from this fish .
no , because i &apos;m a <unk> whiz and grandiose .
that &apos;s actually me .
no , i actually <unk> from this fish <unk> from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation , for chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of history .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the way you know your fish you know is , you know , you have the fish more .
i used him first to eat him in a restaurant in <unk> .
a four-month reporter had been talking about the fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of childlike us with us .
he came down on the table with a light , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
hang twice .
amazingly , he was still serving .
who can make a fish so tasty depending on it ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can &apos;t .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and me .
he &apos;s a biologist in <unk> l.a. .
this is a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> corner of spain .
she &apos;s near the business business of the river .
in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were growing <unk> on what were essentially protected .
they did what they did by digging up the country .
they built these complicated pillars of canals , and they were pushing water from the country and out into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
it was a disaster , it was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds in the world , which is a lot of birds .
and so , in 1982 , a spanish company with green green .
what did they do ?
they &apos;ve got the flow of water to the stream .
they literally <unk> the lever .
instead of <unk> the water , they used the canals to <unk> the water again .
they &apos;re <unk> the canals .
they created a flock of acres in <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , crab , <unk> -- and they have <unk> and his company and its company and its company <unk> out the environmental destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they &apos;re rigid on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all you see are <unk> channels and those density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a <unk> . &quot;
ok ? there we go through the underside of the boat and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> up to my knees , and <unk> <unk> .
here he is taking a rare <unk> .
now , he talked about forming the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , he sees a pattern of bundle that reminded him of the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that <unk> has spent the largest part of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know fish about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relationships . &quot;
and then it goes down into more talking about rare birds and algae and strange <unk> .
and , you know , don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i cut it off . i said , &quot; <unk> , how is it going to taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , young , the algae , the phytoplankton , is incredible .
what are your fish eating ?
what is the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he &apos;s going to talk to me that there &apos;s a very rich system , that the fish would eat what they would like in the wild .
the biomass biomass , the phytoplankton , the rainforests , that is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally ineffective .
there &apos;s no food .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals ?
later on , i went around on this side with <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; i said , &quot; for a place that naturally seem , &quot; rather than any farm i have ever performed , &quot; how do you do , &quot; how do you do it ? &quot;
at the moment , it was like a director of a film company .
and we bent around the corner , and we had to look at the most stunning sight , thousands and thousands of thousands and thousands of thousands upon thousands of acres , literally .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
a-ha ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t succumb to your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent from our fish and <unk> to the birds .
well last year on this site , 600,000 oiled birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest one , and one of the most important private investment has become in entirely europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , the last thing you &apos;d like to have on a <unk> app ? &quot;
he rides his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a heterogeneous network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the human phone , the better the system , the better the system .
ok , let &apos;s <unk> this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed her animals and a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators .
but a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , these <unk> don &apos;t even want to be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
they fly 240 kilometers in the farm .
and every night they &apos;re going to go back 240 miles .
they do it because they can follow the <unk> white line on the <unk> line .
seriously .
i had introduced myself a way to the march of the penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , do you fly 240 miles in the farm , and then they fly 240 miles back in the evening ?
do it for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me , as though i just quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention my beloved fish &apos; characteristics , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost never trying to do that .
and yet , when i saw her in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t look at her <unk> <unk> .
she liked sweet and pure as if you took a bite off from the ocean .
i mentioned this to the <unk> and <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last resort , before something into the body .
it has evolved through evolution to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he added one , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
ok . one farm that doesn &apos;t feed her fish , a farm that measures their success on the success of their predators .
and then i realized , when he says , one farm that doesn &apos;t have a stomach <unk> , <unk> it massive , because the water that comes through these farm comes from the river in the river .
it &apos;s a river that takes all those things that have rivers that have rivers , they tend to lead themselves , chemical pollutants , flow of biofuels .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system , and this leaves the water clean as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it clean the water .
so not only one farm that feeding their beasts , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their stated , but one farm that is literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but it &apos;s also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> water , it cuts the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , because this story , as romantic as it is also <unk> , is also also <unk> .
you could say they &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , where food actually works well .
but , for many people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re lover .
we adore . we love little bits of food ; we &apos;re talking about local food ; we &apos;re eating local food . we &apos;re eating food .
and if they say that these things are the things that the future good food represents , someone goes up somewhere saying , &quot; hey people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people will starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> illusions in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question , because you have the logic of our <unk> relations for the last 50 years .
feed grain grains of grass , <unk> on <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time they &apos;ve just asked agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people , you can &apos;t eat more people like that ? &quot;
it was the motivation . it was the stealing . it was the business of american agriculture .
so we should call them what it is , a nonprofit sector in <unk> , a craft , the rapidly <unk> capital of capital , which is allowed to produce this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our undercover wizards today is threatened , not due to <unk> resources , but by <unk> resources .
not through the state-of-the-art panels and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by pumps , not by <unk> seawater , not by <unk> seawater , but by forests , not by <unk> and forests , but by rainforests in the seas .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that empower every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future menu for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
so capital , chemistry and machines are packed in it , and it has never really produced anything to eat .
let &apos;s watch instead the environmental model .
this is about two billion years <unk> .
look at <unk> farmers , farmers like <unk> .
businesses , who are not worlds for themselves , businesses , <unk> instead of <unk> , businesses , <unk> , instead of only intense intense , farmers who are not just <unk> , but they &apos;re experts for relationships , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are also experts for tastes .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to suggest one thing today is that the totality of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of its parts , instead of trying to think that they can use information as we can use information that they can &apos;t yet be visible .
so what we see here is that what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical component of age .
the program i used here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a source of death , say , &quot; we &apos;re <unk> .
and then i see a different pattern that comes out there .
namely , because there are people who are active and they &apos;re being active over here at the <unk> .
we can step further step further and <unk> the data and then <unk> the data and the usual suspects of the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , if we go further and down to age , we call 40 years or younger , we find that accidents , even the main cause is actually the cause of people to worry about people .
and what he sees is that , among guys , this is true among men .
so you see , you see , look at information and data in this way very closely swimming in a way of swimming in a living symbol of <unk> .
and if we can make these data for raw data , why don &apos;t it ?
what we &apos;ve got here is the intensified director of every single sport , who have ever been printed .
it &apos;s everything here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it after my talk to my talk .
you can dive into a decade , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
they can skip directly to a particular point .
now , if i look here , i see the athlete that comes out in this comic book and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a tech armstrong fan , so i click on what i &apos;m going to show , which is what i &apos;m going to refer to as <unk> armstrong .
now , if i wanted to get a <unk> <unk> , i think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything on the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to go back and take a look at the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea from that kind of information that you stack up on that kind of information , <unk> , large , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t just don &apos;t think or don &apos;t just .
you make something that is actually a bit different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take this idea a little bit broader about something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every one of those images , and we put them down on a little summary .
the summary is a short <unk> and a symbol of the region from which she comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the senior <unk> .
but even in this <unk> perspective , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a glimpse of the subjects that are on wikipedia at the top .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
well , after i selected &apos; government , i &apos;m aware that the experts who sticks most of the blankets are at the same time , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that it &apos;s not in an individual frame .
that &apos;s just when you come back and look at one step and look at it .
looking at a particular summaries of this summaries , i can then go into the subject of time magazine and see everyone together .
now , when i look at these people , i realize that the majority of these people are <unk> . some of them comes from science , some , even less , come from the economy , and here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , a dedication is also a ted prize .
so we can skip now and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we have surfing the web for the first time , which is as though it &apos;s actually a web , not only from side to side , but it &apos;s much abstract .
and so what i want to show you different is what might be a little surprising .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
<unk> , i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every website like this .
so i can go back and skip a bit immediately , and beam immediately into a specific <unk> .
so , that &apos;s why you can only look through web pages in this way and look at the pages of pages in the same way .
so , i can zoom in into my direction in a certain frame of time in a certain frame .
here &apos;s the highest demonstration of the sky that i kept up until there .
and i can kind of look at everything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and so , when i go back and look at everything , and look at everything , i can look at my periodically <unk> , and i look for <unk> , which is looking for bing , or for this to live here for life .
and from this , i can go into the side and call them back again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s chronically used again , and every time it makes it larger than the sum of the <unk> .
at the moment , in this world , we think that data is curse a curse .
we &apos;re talking about oscar curse from the curse .
we &apos;re talking from &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation , and put the internet on the head , so instead of going to go from one to the other , start from many things to many things , and by looking patterns , which is otherwise hidden ?
if we can do it , then this past turns out , maybe there &apos;s a new source of information , maybe there &apos;s a new source of information .
and instead of just moving into information , we get knowledge from it .
and when we know about that , maybe perhaps we can actually even draw <unk> afterwards .
so i thank you , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went off with the bus to school , every day an hour every day .
and my nose always put in a book , on a book , <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , and <unk> my thoughts in other worlds , sheer curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was not in the middle of school , through the forests , traveled and collected frogs , frogs , frogs , frogs and snakes and <unk> , everything went home , and felt under the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limitations of the possible thing .
and my love of science fiction appeared in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau lived in our living room with his amazing shows that we knew animals and places and a world full of wonder we could never have imagined .
so , i think , well , that &apos;s really good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since , in neither video games , these <unk> <unk> <unk> , the entire imagery in the media environment , had to create the imagery in the media environment , i had to create the photos in my mind .
so , we had to all , at the time , when we were reading a book as a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them on the canvas in our heads .
and my response was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , <unk> and whatever .
in the field of <unk> , i was always advised by the teacher , hidden in the textbook , hidden away from the textbook , <unk> .
creativity needed to be kind of out .
and something interesting is something interesting , which fascinated me with jacques <unk> shows , was the thought of a totally unknown world here on our planet .
i certainly would never reach an alien world with a spacecraft , so i felt quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter into the world , and it was equally amazing , and it was as fascinating as it was all the people i &apos;d always imagined when i was reading those books .
so i decided i knew when i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t get distracted by it .
and i finally <unk> my father , until finally , a <unk> <unk> in buffalo , new york , <unk> , on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i put my snorkel in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in the middle of the 1960s in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , got two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the age of 40 years , since now , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water -- 500 hours of water in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep ocean , even in the coastal oceans , is as rich as it is in <unk> life , as we can &apos;t really imagine it .
nature &apos;s imagination doesn &apos;t know borders , very opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
for the days of today , i feel deep awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love for ocean is at the same level with the same intensity as it does .
when i was appointed as an adult job , it was the fancy .
that seemed to be the best way , my core urge , to make stories , with my desire to make images .
as a kid , i &apos;m constantly drawing myself and so .
so , these were films of the way to try to bring images and stories together , fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m talking about , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in <unk> , i could link my predilection for the <unk> and connecting with the <unk> .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in the <unk> problem in this movie -- and we had to create a sort of liquid <unk> problem in this movie , and we picked up on <unk> animation , <unk> , <unk> , back on <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
and what we came up with was the first <unk> <unk> that was ever seen in a movie .
the movie didn &apos;t bring a money , basically , he was just starting his bills , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world , like <unk> of the magic <unk> of it .
according to arthur ganson &apos;s law , you know , <unk> <unk> technology and spells no longer else .
so you saw something magical .
and i discovered that i was incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that really must be involved in the media company . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next movie , and so far .
along with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success has dropped out of it on top of it , just like this effect .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the regime in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve got a little bit of money on the movie .
from those two experiences , there was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for creativity of creativity .
so , i started a company , along with my dear friend , who was at the time of the great friend who was at the time of the best <unk> and <unk> , they used to be called &quot; digital botox . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was to skip the phase analog processes with optical performance , and the motor begin to begin with the same <unk> .
and then we did , and we did , and eventually gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were working in the <unk> and <unk> , which we actually formed the company -- too slow <unk> .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the measure of visual effects and <unk> effects in entirely new heights , <unk> human characters , expressive characters that were created by <unk> , and the world should be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but the measuring press hit pretty well , and people in my company said that we were still not going to be able to do that .
so i decided that , and made this other movie about the big ship , the wall .
so , what i did when i was like &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a <unk> <unk> , a trusted movie of dimensions , a passionate film .
but secretly , i really wanted to go to the real genius of the titanic <unk> .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
however , i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving into the wreckage . we &apos;re films at the wreckage .
we &apos;ll show it in the movie structure of the movie .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a great marketing strategy for marketing . &quot;
and i convinced them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it goes back to that idea that your imagination can create a reality .
and then we actually created a reality of six months later a reality where i bumped into a russian <unk> , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and let me see the actual titanic through a bow of the north atlantic .
it was not a movie , no <unk> , that was a real thing .
so , that really blew my mind .
and on top of it , there were tremendous spaces , and we had to build cameras and construction and build everything .
and i noticed , like this , like a lot of these <unk> , of course .
well , they were also also <unk> , and they were planning to create more sophisticated planning machines .
you immerse up in these capsule , floating into these dark , <unk> environment , where there is no hope of rescue , if you don &apos;t do it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like i &apos;d be in a <unk> device .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really deeply obsessed with the interior of the deep sea .
anyway , from the part of doing with curiosity and science , it was everything . it was adventures , it was a curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a kind of experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could introduce myself to a creature that could make a visual effect on , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see beyond the horizon .
at some of the other expeditions expeditions , i saw being seen in <unk> , sometimes things i hadn &apos;t seen before , sometimes things even before we saw them , even though we saw them haven &apos;t seen them yet .
so this got me right , and i wanted to get more .
and so , i went to an unusual choice .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; look , i want to put my snorkel as a filmmaker in hollywood on ice for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we popped up at the <unk> , and they explored with prednisone shots .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which became a little <unk> .
our purpose was , <unk> , and look at the inside of the ship , which never had been done before .
so , no one had ever done the inside of the <unk> , and you didn &apos;t have any tools for it yet , so we came up with the technology .
so , i &apos;m going to sit on the deck of the titanic , in a golf orchard , and look at the <unk> , and i realize that it &apos;s kind of like the band playing here , and i know that they performed the band there .
and i fly to fly a little bit through the <unk> of the ship .
i actually only <unk> it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt as though , as i could physically find physical inside of the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most complex form of a <unk> i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i went around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i &apos;d run months of <unk> when we did the movie .
and the set was a very detailed copy of the design of the ship .
so this was a very odd experience .
she made me conscious of this <unk> idea that you could use such <unk> <unk> , and as your conscious conscious conscious device can be taken out of these other forms of existence .
it was really very complicated .
and perhaps a small distance in what might happen in a few decades , if you have a belief system to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , which i can think of myself as <unk> .
after these expeditions , we saw what we saw at the bottom of it , which was really appreciate , for example , these <unk> , where we saw these amazing animals , these are sort of dark alien , but here on earth .
they live with help from <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in any sunlight on the ground , as we do it .
and so , you see , what you &apos;re looking at right adjacent to a 500 degree centigrade , they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in <unk> , which was again <unk> from my childhood .
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and they &apos;re sitting in <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , through the mission of the mission .
that was fascinating .
but by the end , it went beyond that i took <unk> with us into the deep sea .
and i took them off and <unk> access to the world at the bottom : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources for them , so they took samples and they could take tools and whatnot , and so on .
and we did , and we did , in fact , made science , but actually science , they said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the circle between my existence as <unk> , as a child , and the reality of the reality .
and over the course of this discovery process , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now you have to have a fox or a director or something like a <unk> or whatever .
but i don &apos;t mind much of leadership before i got these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i going to do here ?
why do i do this ? what comes out ? &quot;
those <unk> films don &apos;t give us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the bills right now . von fame doesn &apos;t decline .
all of the things i think is between the &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; i could put on the nails somewhere on a pile on a pile of ink on a pile of ink on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these fractures , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to make it for the sake of the challenge -- and the oceans is the most empowering environment that there is , you are producing it , and because of the curious connection , which creates a team of people .
because we did all of these things with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were about two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the alarm that you have , because you have a job with it , you can &apos;t tell anyone else .
if you go back and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> , the human <unk> , if you &apos;re working on sea , and then you can &apos;t tell the others . it &apos;s like a police officer or with people who have something through common .
there &apos;s one relationship with each mutual respect .
so , when i come home to my next movie , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to do the same leadership , namely , that you can borrow his team and respect yourself in <unk> societies .
it really became really changed the dynamic .
so there i was going back with a small team on <unk> terrain , and we said , &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that we hadn &apos;t yet before .
extremely exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a <unk> of a kind of four and a half years into a real family .
by doing my way , my way of making films , completely .
so , there were people who said , we felt that we were going to have this super good <unk> and <unk> on the planet .
for me , it was more kind of an ecstatic way of doing my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons did we learned ?
i think the first thing is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
and our imagination is a force that can actually generate reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than every <unk> of this world .
to me , young filmmaker who says , &quot; give me a advice about how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t stand yourself . &quot;
there &apos;s some other for you . don &apos;t you pay yourself , you don &apos;t claim yourself . but take risks on your own . &quot;
nasa has a solar system like this : &quot; failure is no alternative . &quot;
but in the art and researching , we have to fail an alternate choice , because there it certainly ends up .
no big deal of innovation , the innovation demanded , has never been taken .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
that &apos;s the kind of thought i &apos;d like to leave you with the way . failure is not an alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking about energy and climate .
and it may be surprising , because my core communities at the foundation is basically about vaccines and forces to make the things that we need to make , and we need to deliver to the poorest 2 billion life a better life .
but energy and climate are very important for these people , which is actually more important than anyone on the planet .
so <unk> means whose oil reserves are not growing over many years . it cuts too too low , so things will change as it can &apos;t be able to preserve your surroundings environment .
that leads to oddities . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to turbulence .
so , there will be a climate change for you .
it &apos;s also very important for them to be very important for them .
the fact is that if you could just reduce the price of one thing , the energy would be by far by the most vulnerable .
well , the <unk> has dropped over time .
indeed , the <unk> is based on <unk> .
and so the industrial revolution in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid decline in the heart , and that &apos;s why we have irregular refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials , <unk> , we can create modern materials , and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
but if we reduce the cost -- let &apos;s cut down the cost -- we &apos;re launching a new barrier and this barrier on co2 emissions .
co2 warming the planet and the equation of co2 is actually quite clear .
it <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to <unk> some very negatives . effects on the weather , and perhaps worse , and perhaps worse , the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to that rapid ecosystems , and thereby collapse all sorts of systems .
well , the exact opposite between the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and where there are more follow , there are some kind of cheating , but there &apos;s not a lot of them .
and there are certain ambiguity about how awful those are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really need to get closer to close to near zero ?
isn &apos;t half or a neighborhood ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue up .
therefore , it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , well , we &apos;ve got a three-and-a-half 150 truck , which has to come under one three hydrogen hydrogen , and then you can put it in half of it .
this is headed down to the bottom , at zero .
well , we poke out a lot of carbon emissions every year , over 28 billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons , people from poor countries , are less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of batteries on the planet .
and somehow we have to create change that cuts down to zero .
there &apos;s been a constant way up there .
there are only kinds of economic changes that affect it , and we &apos;ve got to go from <unk> ascent , and we &apos;ve got to go from <unk> ascent to a reduction .
this equation has four factors . you have a little bit on the left -- co2 -- which you want to bring towards zero , which is dependent on the number of people on the average of the services , which is the average energy unit for every service and the co2 per unit .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of one , and let &apos;s think about how we get it to zero .
probably , one of those numbers needs to get very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
today , <unk> billion people today .
and it looks at nine billion <unk> <unk> on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , which are <unk> and <unk> , we could certainly reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it involves everything that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
so these are very good things , and <unk> , to make these services accessible to every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great . it &apos;s increasing .
in the wealthy world , in the upper billion , we could certainly make decisions and fewer use , but in average , this number will grow up every year , and therefore doubles more than doubles every number of services .
here we see a very basic services . there &apos;s lights on home so that you can read the homework ?
and these undergraduates , they don &apos;t have it , so they &apos;re going out and they &apos;re reading their heads under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per services , there is finally good news .
we have something that is not going up .
because of different successes in <unk> , by other forms , through new methods in <unk> , there are a lot of services , depending on whose amounts of services , they reduce rainfall rates by 90 percent .
in other ways , it &apos;s been reviewed , bacillus gaga : <unk> gaga <unk> : <unk> -- &amp; amp ; t <unk> ; <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , is the window for improvement very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we might get a chance to come up with a factor of 3 or maybe even by a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now moved from 26 billion approaches to maybe 13 billion tons of tons , and that is simply not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- this is the amount of co2 that is embodied energy per unit per unit .
it turns out , if you can get it to zero .
when they burn charcoal , no .
if they burn natural gas , they no .
almost every domestic banks for electricity today , co2 emissions , except the renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now if i use the term &quot; miracle &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a wonder . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people have helped to build a lot of those of this wonder .
ordinarily , they don &apos;t usually realize that you need a magic date to a particular date .
usually you &apos;re just going to get them wrong , and some come from , others don &apos;t .
in this case , we have to give <unk> and get a miracle in a very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really deliver this really ?
is it a natural <unk> , a demonstration demonstration , a demonstration of the people &apos;s imaginations here ?
i remember myself last year when i got mosquitoes and somehow kind of liked the people .
the idea was really tangibilitate , you know , you know that there are people living with mosquitoes .
for energy , i got this one .
i decided that i would submit that , from fireflies , i would say , &quot; fireflies &apos;s going to be here on the environment . &quot;
so here , some natural fireflies are fireflies fireflies .
so you &apos;ve assured me that they won &apos;t bite . they don &apos;t even want to leave the glass .
now , there are all sorts of analyses like this , but they don &apos;t get everyone .
we need solutions either , one or one of the many ways that we have an existing array of extremes of scaling and incredible accountability , and even though there is many directions where people are looking for it , i really can only see five those big metabolic demands .
i have the tides , <unk> , <unk> and biofuels .
so , this may have a piece of cake and if you &apos;re better than i expect , but my final line here is that we have to work at all those five , and we can &apos;t get charged from them because they &apos;re hostile problems , because everyone has a significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels from either coal or natural fossil fuels from either either coal or natural gas .
what you &apos;ve got to do there may be just plain , but it is not . you have to get all of the co2 coming out of the ground , puddle of pressure , put together pressure , and then hope there &apos;s stayed there .
there are a number of people who are working on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it turns on 100 percent , get very difficult for the co2 of the co2 , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who will make it safe ?
what can you do , which is literally a lot of billions of a billion times bigger than any kind of trash that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a volume of volume .
so , this is some tough nut .
next : <unk> .
there &apos;s also three big problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , and the question for sure is that you really felt that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you then do with waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not really big , there is a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that are possibly soluble , and they &apos;re supposed to work on that .
the last three of five have put me in .
it &apos;s the renewables they &apos;re often called , as they &apos;re often called .
and they have -- even though it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need a fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density , those of those technologies are dramatically smaller than that .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many times , 1,000 times more than a regular power station .
and then these sources <unk> <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and as it does , the wind does not shine all the time either .
so , you need to , if you depend on those sources , you have to have a way that energy is not available in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there is big data here . there are challenges in the transmission , so if we say , for example , the energy sources from the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they need to deal with the risk of where different emerges from where they come from .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and to illustrate the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , look at cars , computers , <unk> , for everything , and i &apos;ve been using it with the amount of electronic energy , which is used in the world .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be better than a factor of 100 than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to say these 25,000 sources of how to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to rely on 100 percent on it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project ? &quot; how do we get ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need to get at least 100 people .
in many , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re mad ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot here in the ted group there .
bill gross has a number of companies , among other things , one called <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invest in dozens companies doing great things , and interesting choice , and i &apos;m trying to support that .
nathan myhrvold : and i &apos;m finance a company , who , maybe a company , has followed a nuclear approach .
there are some innovation in the icefall ; <unk> , liquid .
so , evolution has dropped out in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good ideas lying around .
the <unk> , instead of a part of the <unk> , which one percent , the <unk> , decided we decided to burn 99 percent , which is <unk> .
this is a pretty insane idea .
but actually , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you can never see it as well , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see that , yes , it &apos;s going to look at it .
and because you burn those 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
indeed , you burn trash , and you can even use the waste from what we used to use today as a crab .
instead of breaking your mind , they &apos;re just going to burn it . it &apos;s a great thing .
so , uranium uses the platform , a bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s kind of a sort of cool thing , often known as a &quot; traveling bouncing of reactors . &quot;
that really bothers the <unk> .
there &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the 99 percent , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s going to be burned today , so it becomes uranium uranium .
the u.s. <unk> for hundreds of years .
and if you throw inexpensive inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet &apos;s lifetime .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward to forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go up to the goal we have to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
a lot of them talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and we will still do something more agriculture , and hopefully will be clean and clean up until there will be clean and clean up until there is clean .
so , to reach those 80 percent , the industrialized nations , including countries like china , their homeland production .
the other note says whether we use the most sophisticated technology , if they deployed in all the advanced countries , and we &apos;re on the road to the rest of them .
that &apos;s really important .
this becomes an element of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , what we should look like by 2020 ?
it would be used again to contain the two elements again .
we should be able to use the <unk> to put reduction in the way , which is the less we need , and the temperature turns off , and the temperature turns out to be the temperature of temperature .
but actually , the tone that we do , which is not completely lead to the big market , just like the same , or even something less important as the others , which is the speed of innovation for those breakthroughs .
these changes we have to do with self-reflection , and we can measure this : in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of great books on this topic .
the al gore book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> called &quot; <unk> energy <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they &apos;re going to go through it , and create a framework where this can happen , because we need all the pages of all the pages .
there &apos;s something that needs to get together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very useful desire , we &apos;re going to invent this technology .
so if you just pick up a prize for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose this desire , which is , <unk> <unk> , and i could take that wish , which is , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
this has the greatest impact .
now if we don &apos;t get that desire , the trench between the long term and the term will be terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and wealthy , and almost every lifetime of that two billion are going to be worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we have to use for more research .
if countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they would discuss these <unk> , and they would be devastated by the ridiculously small money that would be obtained for these innovative ways .
we need <unk> , co2 taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; force something that creates a difference spot .
we have to spread the message .
we need to bring dialogue into dialogue , and then we have to have the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thanks very much .
thanks very much .
thank you . thank you .
so thanks very much . just to try to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to try the simulation in a supercomputer , all big scientists have to do what we &apos;ve done , we need only some 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactors to make sure that it works well , you &apos;re only in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is to make the first <unk> , to find another billion , which is the <unk> and the place that actually builds the first of it .
once the first thing is , when it &apos;s done , as i &apos;m guessing , it &apos;s clearly clear because the economy is so different , because the energy , the energy , is as different as you know it .
to get the right thing , which is to build deep into the ground , almost like a vertical plank of nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starts working on the process .
<unk> : right . so you have to <unk> the reactor , so you have a lot of people and a lot of control that can go wrong . this is where you stack it up and stuff <unk> , and it &apos;s not good .
but if you have a very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re buried in it without the whole complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s been done for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> who offers himself a solution for the trash .
<unk> : yeah . what happens is you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less trash with this method -- there &apos;s a lot less trash with this method -- and they &apos;re going to burn it up in the next slice , and burning it .
and we begin by taking the waste , which exists already in these <unk> , or <unk> on those reactors , and that &apos;s our <unk> .
so , what on these reactors is a problem , what we put in our adsense , and we &apos;re going to minimize dramatically dramatically during this process .
but as you &apos;ve been talking about these different people of these world , they &apos;ve talked about these interventions .
where is the greatest interest in what &apos;s really going on ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t set up a place yet , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting design for everything we have in the name . there &apos;s big interest and people of the company in russia , india , china , china -- i was here and talked about how to fit .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is another version of a thing that was done .
so this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built these , so that &apos;s why everyone has invented a rapid reactor , a <unk> for our first .
so in your idea : <unk> and chance of calling something truly life to bring in life ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> things , <unk> things , which are very cheaply , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years in charge .
so that &apos;s kind of the <unk> that we have to address the <unk> , which we need to address .
and , you know , <unk> , if everything &apos;s ok , and that &apos;s a big desire , it might be easily .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies now , and we need hundreds of them , which works , as well , as their approaches work working on recovery airplanes for their pilots .
and it would be the best if it could be multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
do the big breakthroughs , though , is this the greatest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
it &apos;s been done without the <unk> , but the power of doing it so much more important .
in the undercover sector , there are other kinds of other companies .
you know , you don &apos;t know your work as well as these , but there is the modular method , which is a different approach .
there &apos;s a bomb system , which seems a little bit hard , but perhaps they say about us .
and so there are different , but the beauty of it is , there &apos;s a million times a million times as much energy as it is , and so , if you deal with the problems , and these are basically the radiation , the footprint and the costs , and the costs , of course , in your own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to introduce <unk> norms to try to maintain the stable stable environment ?
<unk> : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much , and you &apos;re going to have a heart attack on a heart attack , which is what you do then ? you might need a nuclear weapon or something like that .
there &apos;s been a cortical processor called <unk> , which deals with various techniques to delay the warming , so we pay for 20 or 30 years to take care of us .
this is just a non-zero-sum game .
you hoped that we don &apos;t need it .
some people say , you know , you shouldn &apos;t work on bills because maybe you &apos;re doing something that you &apos;re eating , and you &apos;re eating , and you know that you &apos;re going to save a rescue society .
i don &apos;t know whether it &apos;s smart , if you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in <unk> about whether you have to do that , if things get faster , or take this innovation longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two words for trying to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the emancipation of the skeptics live in very disparate camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very short .
do you say that there &apos;s a downside to the side of the clouds that make things move to the clouds ?
there are very , very few things you can say , which is a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake , and you get paid for a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you &apos;ve got all sorts of popularity problems to invest in something you just have -- and you realize that the bell is not so clear . it is not necessarily the worst elections , and there are people in the rich world who look tectonic and say , ok , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worried .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and the co2 release , and then the skeptics said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m not sure that it does not make co2 , i wish , &quot; i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be the answer to the most fundamental conclusion that , if you take all of those co2 and energy , all the other goals below the co2 , the <unk> , which is none of malaria , and so on , there is a stupid flow of resources that we can do with it , while there are better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the actual spending on research -- say we should spend 10 billion dollars per year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
among other things , other things should not suffer .
you then get too big <unk> , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that is not economically , and try to finance it .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> program and funded the learning curve . i think we should try more things that have potential , much more expensive .
if the <unk> you get , a very high <unk> , you can only keep the rich up there .
i mean , each of us could spend five times as much on our energy without changing .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> is around .
his new <unk> is , &quot; why won &apos;t discuss research anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still still because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that it is a very lonely group , and therefore , he &apos;s got to do it now .
and that &apos;s one of the kind of a mentality i think for .
research , it &apos;s just boggles your mind , it &apos;s just going to be backed up .
bill , i &apos;m responsible for almost all of the people here , when i say , i hope you &apos;ll get true . thank you , thank you very much .
vc : thank you .
a couple years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> launched a <unk> stain called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . <unk> has to build the largest <unk> structure with 20 degrees , about <unk> tape , about three feet , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has got to be on top .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard really hard because it makes people like it really fast .
and so , i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i think it turns into an interesting idea .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , academy and architects , even with the <unk> of the <unk> , and there &apos;s something about this job , which is deeply peculiar in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start trying to get themselves to the task themselves .
they &apos;re talking about it , they think it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to make it look like it &apos;s going to look like it , they &apos;re talking about it , you &apos;re talking about it , you &apos;re talking about it .
they invest a little bit of planning in planning and an organization . they &apos;re drawing and lay out of spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> structures structure .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have a time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it gently down to the top , step back and forth , and do you admire your work .
and what happens , almost always , is what happens is that the juicy thing becomes a <unk> , because the weight of the <unk> is going to make the <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more radical &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> than others , and under the worst , are fresh <unk> .
she &apos;s lying , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re <unk> , and they really make <unk> shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more called &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , and among the best , they &apos;re fresh alumni of <unk> .
and this is quite astounding .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter told : &quot; none of the kids spend a time in his head of spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in time in <unk> .
there &apos;s still another reason .
namely , that drug models were being trained to find the right agenda , ok .
and then realizing it &apos;s time .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> different is that they &apos;ll start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they can <unk> the possibility of <unk> prototypes .
<unk> , these kinds of collaboration , as a core <unk> <unk> .
and with each try , kids get immediately feedback , and what they don &apos;t do .
so , the performance is working with working with prototypes , a lot -- but look at what different teams are doing .
the average for most is about 50 percent , <unk> , half of those , lawyers are doing something more , but not too much , <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
three is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because you understand triangles and <unk> geometric patterns , the key to create stable structures .
ceo are lying on average , but here &apos;s going to be interesting .
you put an <unk> team on the team , you &apos;re getting significant numbers better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict this . why is this ?
because they have special properties of <unk> .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team that <unk> and on the work is actually going to improve the performance of the teams .
so , more sensitive and <unk> and the combination of the combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams who are typical , you get about six , the stable structures have about six , the stable structures have .
i try to try something interesting .
i thought , well , let &apos;s put the <unk> in the same way .
so i was offering a $ $ loan for the winner for the winner .
what do you think about that <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happens here . it was a firm a firm stable structure .
if anyone had a <unk> high building , he would have spent the paycheck home .
so , wouldn &apos;t it be interesting , that high force has a strong effect ?
we did this practice at the same time with the same students .
what do you think it happened ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so from the same , bad team of one among the best .
they produced the highest construction produced in the least time .
so , there are <unk> lessons for us , about the nature of desire and success .
you might ask : why would someone spend time trying to make a difference ?
the reason is , i &apos;m able to help digital digital tools and processes to create teams , create cars , video games and <unk> <unk> .
and what the <unk> is doing , it helps you to identify the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every one has his own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , which is as simple practice .
and those of you who are interested in it can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how you build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a toyota <unk> there .
they find mad examples from around the world , like people optimize system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> acid .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport sport .
it demands that we all aspire to fix our senses , and we use our thinking as well as our feelings and our doing , in the challenge , that we think about ourselves .
and sometimes a little prototype of the experience of this experience is everything takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
do we pretend that we have a machine here .
a big machine , a machine machine machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room has to come in .
and they can go into the past ; they can &apos;t go into the future ; they can &apos;t stay in there .
and i wonder what they would choose , because i asked my friends at the last time often asked this question , and they wanted everybody to go into the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back in time before there could be a twitter or twitter or &quot; america search of america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re kind of drawn to <unk> , which is drawn to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurers .
it &apos;s because there &apos;s no chance on this planet , you &apos;re going to go ahead and go ahead .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
so , this is the greatest times that we have on this planet , no matter what scale they &apos;re building : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities , metrics <unk> .
never had a time like this .
my bitches all died when they were 60 .
my maternal grandparents <unk> this number of <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there &apos;s better one at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child born today in delhi can expect to live as much as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox , smallpox had killed billion people on this planet .
they &apos;ve created the demographics in the united states in a way shaped like no war .
they &apos;re gone off . they have vanished .
we &apos;ve got them <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , there are diseases that have seen millions of us just a generation of us just a generation alone , not yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone still knows what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billion people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method of trying to try stuff , see if it &apos;s done , it will change if it isn &apos;t doing it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been talked a lot more often .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , one billion people on this planet are going to get hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to <unk> the world .
water , <unk> land , rainforests , of oil , gas , gas , gas , instead soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we disappear too .
so the question is , can we do this ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food waste that will feed billion people , without the country where they live , to raping .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t break them at the same time .
i really think that &apos;s really , and no , this is not a <unk> .
but this is what keeps me awake from me -- one of the things that keeps me awake at the night . we &apos;ve never needed more than that .
and we &apos;ve never been able to do it , <unk> it , so we can now do it today .
we &apos;re at the threshold , remarkably events at many places , and yet , i really think we have to go back hundreds and millions of years before the enlightenment , and we think about those things that we &apos;ve been fighting about those things that we &apos;ve been talking about these things more than now .
people wrap up in their faith , and that &apos;s so deeply that you can &apos;t free them .
it &apos;s not even the truth of it .
and listen , everyone has a pretty right in his opinion . even a law on his opinion .
but do you know what they don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a pretty right on their own facts . &apos; <unk> , they haven &apos;t got it .
and i took a while to figure out what to do .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was stunned by resistance , by resistance , by the way , which is the most fundamental health initiative in the health care system in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i was always doing , i wrote a articles and i did .
and soon after that , i wrote a paper about <unk> food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper on it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they felt that molecules had been in a particular way , a random way of putting a <unk> out of nature in nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article ; i continued on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we &apos;re typing , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , this is ok .
but these articles made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and eventually i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these were these <unk> who didn &apos;t bother me at all .
these were people starving people , educated people , <unk> people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that got me so mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a tipping point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress .
we &apos;re talking <unk> about it .
we &apos;re talking explosives about it , with little quotes about it , &quot; progress . &quot;
so , for example , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science of itself , and there &apos;s no reason why that is not going to be that way .
you can just call a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who believed that they were always quite rightly . so they were kind of cheating .
ask them questions , desire them , desire them , desire them .
take nothing for granted .
but now , if you get evidence of evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell from the reason that we now live in an epidemic of dread of dread , as i haven &apos;t seen it , and hopefully will never see again again .
about about 12 years ago , a story has been released , a terrible history , which was the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and bring genetic vaccine into compounds .
very frightening .
a lot of studies have been done to see if that was true .
lots of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , none of them .
it doesn &apos;t make difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what we believe is what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a cluster of <unk> documents that we have data , and i understand that , and i understand that , i think we &apos;re all doing this .
but do you know what ?
the result of it was disaster .
disaster because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the <unk> is falling down .
this is <unk> , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what &apos;s happening is that we could do it .
well , i understand that . i do .
because what does someone do here ?
does one one in the audience would see someone dying ?
don &apos;t often happen very often .
in this country , in fact , not yet , but grew around the world in the last year .
these are many deaths through measles , 20 per hour .
but because this isn &apos;t going on here , we can displace it , and people like fred <unk> can walk around and send messages of fear and disagree of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they can &apos;t link the cause and correlation with correlation .
you don &apos;t realize that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we have to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the most horrifying masterpieces of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared , disappeared , disappeared , vanished .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s name paul <unk> .
he just created a bunch of other people a few other people .
he can save life from <unk> , 500,000 children every year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul <unk> and talk about vaccines , and tell people how valuable they are , and that people simply stop <unk> .
and that &apos;s actually what he actually says .
paul is a terrorist .
when paul in public speaks speaks , he cannot algorithmically arms sentinels .
he &apos;s got phone calls at home , because people like to tell him , you know , where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul has a vaccine vaccine .
i don &apos;t want to say that , but vaccines are essential .
take them off , drop the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s going on right now .
we have in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a <unk> of mine posted me a few weeks ago , and i think she &apos;s convinced me a little bit of <unk> .
no one has ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her children against <unk> . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t know in this country , yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s someone in the morning somewhere in lagos , and it &apos;s going to fly into los angeles , right now , at the moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he goes to long beach , and he will go for long beach , and he will visit one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that it &apos;s infected with a disease illness , and we don &apos;t know it , because this is what the world is going to do now .
this is the planet where we live . don &apos;t pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to wrap us up in lying . we love that .
have you taken all of your teeth today ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that helps you with the jumps .
i know you &apos;ve done it , because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take some alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find it is useless .
the data is done all the time .
they make urine at their urine . they do almost never .
that &apos;s ok , you want 28 billion dollars to pay for dark urine for dark urine .
i don &apos;t agree with them .
darker urine . dark . dark . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine . dark urine .
why do we do this ? why do we do it ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do it either . our health care system is weakness .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to us who can afford it .
so , we &apos;re going to go off , and where are we going to go ?
we &apos;re going to go into the arms of the corporation .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really serious business , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billion dollars on it .
and i have all kinds of little <unk> here .
none of it -- <unk> , cheating , cheating , cheating , cheating , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we spend billion dollars on it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say , people call me and say , &quot; what care does you do ? let people do what you want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> who says , &quot; uh , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some <unk> that wants his patients with self-reflection .
if they &apos;re gone down on this way , where faith and magic <unk> and science , they come up with a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he put 400,000 people around , because he insisted that red <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> a lot more effectively than <unk> drugs , which we know is that they can extract the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of oiled deaths in a country that gets worse than every other of this disease becomes <unk> .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have unintended consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the <unk> epidemic in which we are right now , is this ridiculous struggle between <unk> <unk> , <unk> food and <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat , each <unk> , every leafy twig , every <unk> , has been changed by people .
you know , there was no shortage of paradise in paradise .
there were no <unk> .
there were no <unk> . we did it all .
we did it in the last 48 years .
and some of it &apos;s done , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we got rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now , we can make it more closely . and , of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a.
you don &apos;t want to do it ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss earlier food plants .
why do we do this ?
now , what i &apos;m going to hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want nonprofits to look lives .
we don &apos;t want businesses to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is for all of this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix that . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> problem , but it &apos;s not science .
it &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
she &apos;s not a country .
she &apos;s not even an idea ; she &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but it does sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do your work , because we &apos;re afraid of human beings from flourish .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll grow 70 percent more food than it is right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need it , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like , for example , cassava .
cassava is something that is worth of half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a cluttered calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrition , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people would be eating , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t be starving , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , do we ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to want genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes ; it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on paying food , better food , unique food , unprecedented food .
this is not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to end up time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do what we do , we owe ourselves to something we don &apos;t want to be guilty about , that we don &apos;t really want to be guilty of .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s not ours , and we have to really fix it .
so , having this incredibly funny entertainment talk , you might want to say , &quot; do you always want to go and go into this ridiculous thing and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , so i want to definitely . i want to anyway .
right now , they &apos;re in the present tense , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can &apos;t ask those time to go through anything we want .
we can <unk> them , where we &apos;re going to go into them , and we &apos;re going to get them there , where we &apos;re going to go there .
we have to get those conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into time and go into the future , we will be happy to have done it .
i know we can do it , and as far as it &apos;s mine , is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for a while now , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it sounds like a magician &apos;s been interested in it , but you look at it like me , as a &quot; a delusion that becomes something true when someone thinks only enough of it . &quot;
in other words , a measurable effect in some studies have showed some measurable effects , which is just why the person thinks what happens with her is a <unk> or a type of -- in the <unk> , for example , there &apos;s a measurable effect on the body that &apos;s called the <unk> effect in the body .
a deception becomes a serious thing , because someone gets it so .
so let &apos;s also show each other , i &apos;m going to show you some basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at least since the 1950s .
i even learned him from the <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain him for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , you see what happens .
the knife they can analyze , my hand , which they can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife in my hands .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
you see , you can see that there &apos;s no time anything . so as long as i duck down here , you can &apos;t come up with my sleeve or come out of my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything &apos;s good , is going to offset the knife by my bare physical .
it &apos;s actually very strong in its place that i &apos;m able to shake it , without tearing out the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out of my sleeve , don &apos;t <unk> . and you can study anything .
a-ha !
now , this is a trick that i have many children who are interested in spells out spells because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
many of you probably know many of you here in this room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say i wrist my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or disappear , and that &apos;s a mom .
the reason why i <unk> my wrist is that there &apos;s the actual secret of the illusion .
at the moment , where i <unk> my hand from you , so you &apos;re going to see it from behind , so this fingers here , my <unk> , just from where he was so extended from where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone in behind someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i duck down , he &apos;s changing his position .
and now you might talk about why this is a deception line , why you don &apos;t perceive that there are only three fingers to see : because the mind and the way you process information , they don &apos;t necessarily count one , one , two , three , three , but it sees them as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not actually right now . and then i open my hand .
and of course there &apos;s been selected , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by me , being able to walk through this movement , is that it turns out that your fingers is falling again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show her friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does it have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i was reading a study that really blew my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and therefore , i was an amazing thing .
because what it turns out is , if you put a placebo placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an orb pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill ball , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if they shape the shape they &apos;re going to take on , for example , in a smaller pill , for example in a smaller pill , and to make those blue color and make a letters on it , you &apos;re actually increasing more effective .
and this , although none of these things -- they &apos;re just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really freaking weird .
but it turns out there &apos;s still no everything else .
if you take carbon nanotubes , they &apos;re still more effective than every form .
so , there &apos;s a colored capsule that &apos;s got yellow in one end , and the other red is better than a runaway capsule .
also the texture plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the carefully statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
the key thing is , ...
... that &apos;s also the role of play games .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you &apos;re going to have the ultimate <unk> , you need to grab into the needle .
right ? one needle with a <unk> substance -- a couple of <unk> of a <unk> substance that gives you a patient .
so that creates a very strong image in your head . this is a lot stronger than a white ball .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you one different time when we &apos;ve got a projector projector .
so , in fact , the white ball does not shine as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t respond as well as a capsule reaction that does not respond as well as the needle .
and none of it really does have some really irrational property , and it &apos;s just our belief that we &apos;ve done a stronger impact on us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something which is obviously a deception line , and make it look real .
so , we know from the study of that study that you have to grab out of the needle if it &apos;s going to go .
this is a 18 inches long arc . it &apos;s very , very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to do it first a little bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> specifically , specifically selected by special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a lot of hollywood from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to pull this needle into my skin and walk through it , until it &apos;s pushing again on the other side of it .
if you &apos;re evil , if you &apos;re slightly breaking out -- i &apos;ve done a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and there &apos;s a lady of almost powerless .
so i propose , if you &apos;re going to look pretty miserable , you &apos;ll look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first dark component here .
you can see it in the same , you can see , but also <unk> , if you want .
so , i &apos;m going to go right here , where my meat is starting on the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side , again , again .
now , we &apos;re actually cambodians in the same kind of time that we had at the same time .
about that .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
now , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; ok , that &apos;s not so stupid and <unk> yourself the skin , purely to talk for us a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; ok . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
the people in the labs come in now .
let me show you what i &apos;m showing you from here .
this is really my skin . this is a lot of hollywood from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can fix the <unk> .
sorry . if you get evil , look off , look , don &apos;t look .
the people behind , or who , later on , at some point on video , will say , &quot; well , yes , this looks pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would look like it &apos;s a hole and there , if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . &quot;
ok , so let me recap some blood for you .
yeah , this is it .
ordinarily , i would put out the needle now .
i would clean up my arm and show you that there are no <unk> .
but i think in this room , and i &apos;m thinking about trying to make a real real real thing , i &apos;m going to make the needle just going out there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;ll look at it . thanks very much .
everyone speaks today about happiness .
i &apos;ve been predicting the number of books , which are linked to &quot; sincerity &quot; in the title of the last five years , and they gave us a lot more about it , and there were a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interests of the interests of happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this <unk> of work , there &apos;s several cognitive ones that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to fall into these cognitive journals .
and it &apos;s true for <unk> who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are the same mess as anyone else .
the first one is a <unk> , complexity <unk> .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we use it on too many different things .
so , i think there &apos;s a particular significance that we can narrow it , but in big and all the things we have to add up , and we &apos;re going to have the complex view of what is well-being .
the second set of view is a reflection of experience and memory : basically , you &apos;ll be between yourself in his life and be happy with his life or happy to live with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different designs , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of luck .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affect well-being without its significance .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive phenomenon .
there is simply no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who wrote a story on one of my lectures , who came up with one story . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful in the end of the recording room .
and then he added to that , actually , emotionally emotionally , who ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
they were not counted , because he was interrogated by memory , memory was ruined , and memory was everything he had to stay with .
what really bothers us is that we can think about ourselves and think about other people in the spirit of two ways .
there &apos;s a daily life that lives in the present tense and present the present , is able to improve the past , but it &apos;s only the present .
it &apos;s <unk> yourself , which is the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt now if i put it on here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is this , the <unk> and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that says , &quot; how did you feel a lot lately ? &quot;
or , what was her journey to albania ? &quot; or so .
these are two very different units , the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and the <unk> part of the <unk> is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> themselves is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental response on our memories -- it starts instantly .
we don &apos;t only tell stories about telling us stories about stories .
our memory stories tell us stories , which is what we must keep from our experience , is to have a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who are trying to perform a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into the details . it &apos;s not more painful , but it was painful than this study in the world .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;ve suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
the patient b has dropped more steeply . his specialty was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a has had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s one other question , &quot; how did these patients feel that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient had a lot worse worse on the standard performance workers than the patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because it &apos;s a very important part of the story , as it ends up .
and none of these stories is very strong or great -- but one of them is facts .
but one of them is worse worse than the other ones .
and the worse is that , when the pain went out at the end at its lowest level , it was a very bad story .
where do we know ?
because we asked these people after their favorite questions , and also a lot later said , &quot; how awful was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a much more than b in the world .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves .
from the point of view , b has dropped an entirely worse time .
so what you could do with a team , and we actually did clinical trials , and it has been done , and it turns out , actually , you could actually increase the patient &apos;s goal from the patient a lot by positioning at the tubing .
and that &apos;s going to have a belief that the patient is suffering , but only a little bit less than it is .
and if you &apos;ve done a couple of minutes long , you &apos;ve got a lot of worse from patients a lot worse on , and you &apos;ve got a lot better , because you &apos;ve given a patient a lot better , because you &apos;ve given a patient to a better history of his experience .
what draws a story from ?
and it &apos;s true for the stories that makes us memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
and what a story of <unk> is <unk> , major moments and end .
end very , very important , and in this case , <unk> , the end of this case .
now , the <unk> himself lives his life continuously .
it &apos;s got moments of the <unk> dynasty , one after the other .
and you ask : what &apos;s going on with these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean , most of our moments of our lives -- and i knew -- you know , the psychological presence is true than about three seconds , which means , you know , there is about 600 million of them , in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 .
most of them will be completely ignored by the <unk> themselves .
and yet , somehow they get the idea that they count , that what happens during those moments of grass is what happens is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we use in this world .
and as we use them , it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not the history that <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and they &apos;re really quite quite different .
the biggest difference between them is about managing time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation and second week just as well as the first week , the <unk> vacation is twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that doesn &apos;t really work for the <unk> themselves .
for the <unk> themselves , a <unk> squid isn &apos;t a little bit better than the <unk> vacation because there are no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the history .
and in this sense , the variable is actually the critical variable , which is quite different from a <unk> self , and has a very short impact on this story .
now , <unk> yourself does more than to remind yourself and stories .
it &apos;s actually that the decisions , because if you have a patient who , if you have a patient , who is , say , two different tribal surgeons , and decides what to choose , which is the head of choosing who is less bad and that is the surgeon who is going to be selected .
and the <unk> himself does not have a voice in that choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose between experiences of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at it as a sense of self as a sense of self , and you can think of yourself as one , which is kind of like the greek <unk> themselves through experiences that don &apos;t need the <unk> themselves .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re on vacation , which is a very common case , which is , we &apos;re doing <unk> , in the services of the <unk> themselves .
and that &apos;s kind of hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we feel from our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations for the domination of the <unk> themselves .
and if i think about that , i think about a holiday that we did about a few years ago , which was obviously the best vacation i had ever had , and i think quite often related to the relationship with how often i often think about other people .
and i probably would probably go from my memories about this <unk> journey , i &apos;d say about 25 minutes long in the last four years .
well , if i could ever have the top of the skeleton with the 600 images of it in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and this is about a minute and a half .
there it seems to be a disagreement .
now , i &apos;d like to be a little extreme , you know , how little <unk> i have on the inputs of memories , but even if they &apos;re doing more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give out memories of our memories ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine if you &apos;re on vacation , you know , at the end of the <unk> , you know , at the end of <unk> , you get a regular drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holidays ?
and then , if you would choose a conflict between your two sides of yourself and you have to think about how you choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of your mind , you might have a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> solution , which is a problem with a choice between the two choices .
well , the two ways of themselves throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , which is one per self .
so you can ask yourself : how happy is the <unk> themselves ?
and then they would ask : how happy are these moments in life of <unk> themselves ?
and they &apos;re all -- lucky for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the characteristics that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of being the <unk> of the <unk> themselves of the time .
so if you ask yourself to ask yourself at the moment of appreciating yourself , it &apos;s a totally different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased is the person when they think about their lives .
very different term .
so , each one of these terms is not going to determine the basic level of happiness , and i &apos;m one of a lot of researchers about well-being , which is the study of happiness , which are the exploration of our happiness in the same way .
the distinction between the <unk> themselves and the joy of appreciating themselves in the last few years has been recognized , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two bricks .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where many of a million people have been asked to ask about what they think about their lives , and about their experiences , and there were other kinds of efforts in the direction .
so , in the last years , we started learning about the happiness of these two types of selves .
and the main lesson we do , i think , have learned is that they are really different .
you know how satisfied someone is with his life , and it teaches them not much about how happy he lives his life , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of relation from correlation , correlation in relation to it .
what that means is that if you meet someone , you would say , &quot; oh , his dad is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his scale , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is to be with his <unk> himself .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what the average design is about .
we know that money matters very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness basically means to be satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you honor the happiness of the two types of choices , they will do very different things on the end of the self .
the implication of what i &apos;m saying here is that we really shouldn &apos;t really think of happiness as a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s a totally different term .
now , very short , another reason that we don &apos;t really realize about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live life .
so if you ask the easy question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you know , people in california have to be happier when they say , let &apos;s say , in ohio life .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t really important for the <unk> themselves , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> themselves , which decides how happy people are .
well , because the <unk> is responsible for yourself , you end up at the end -- some people would draw at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track , which is what happens to people who are going to allow california to get happier , happier .
now , your 401 plan yourself won &apos;t be happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you will be reminded of how awful the weather in ohio was , and they will sense they &apos;ve made the real decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope to give you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thanks very much .
now , when we talked about a bunch of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting results that came out of this place at this place .
is that something you can tell us , because they have a few minutes right now ?
daniel libeskind : safe .
i think the most interesting results that we found in the place at the gallup survey is a number that we absolutely haven &apos;t expected .
we discovered this in terms of the joy of the <unk> themselves .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out there &apos;s one percent of 50 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very big sample from americans , about 600,000 dollars , but it &apos;s a big representative sample under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year &apos;s population , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy than they will .
we get a totally flat line on this .
i mean , i haven &apos;t seen that flat lines .
what happens , obviously , is that money doesn &apos;t raise a discount , but that lack of money we could raise a lot of money , and we can actually measure that misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other yourself , the <unk> themselves , you get another story .
the more money you make , the more money you get .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , liberty , ambition for happiness .
so if people take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it appears to put everything on your mind , everything that we think , for example , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there a chance that politicians snatch that country is going to take a lot of carbon out of this country as serious as it would be serious about politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think recognition is responsible for the role of politics in politics .
the recognition will be slow down in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening now and in other countries , it &apos;s going to happen .
the people are about to think that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;ll take a while , and people will discuss whether they &apos;re going to study <unk> , or if they &apos;re going to explore <unk> , so we need to think about this discussion quite quite soon .
how to improve your happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> themselves , or whether you think about the <unk> themselves .
that &apos;s going to change politics , i think , in the future years .
in the united states , you &apos;re looking at trying to measure the compositions of the population .
that will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it sounds like me , or should at least the most interesting political debate going on for the next few years .
thanks very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i &apos;m building video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , and my aim for the next decade is to make it as easy to save the world in reality , as they &apos;re rescue in <unk> .
i have a design for that . i want to persuade more people , including all of you , spend more time playing more and more playing games .
currently we spend 3 billion hours a week working with <unk> .
some of you might say , &quot; this is a whole host of play . &quot;
perhaps something too much when you realize how many problems we really have in the real world .
but actually , my research on the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week isn &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m sure that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we &apos;re going to have to increase it dramatically .
i calculated that that needed time for 21 billion hours a week .
so , first of all , it turns out , when we look at things , if problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and poverty , i think we need to try to play business online for at least 21 billion hours per week .
no , really serious .
why ? this is a picture of pretty much why i think that games are so vital for the survival of the human species in the future . serious .
this is a video of the photographer <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he set up a camera set up to the players .
this is one of the classical expressions play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might drop some of the many of the nuances in this picture .
you see , you &apos;re likely to see this sense of urgency , something fearful , but also focus and focus on solving a very difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some of the many nuances here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of something called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you guys know . ok . so we have a couple of players here .
a <unk> defeat is a result that so powerfully positive is you didn &apos;t know it before it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and when they do it , they &apos;re kind of shock that they &apos;re actually capable of capable of something like this . this is a <unk> victory .
the player is short in front of a <unk> victory .
and this is what we need to see on the millions of polygons around the world , if we look at the barriers of the next century , and the face of those , the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> at the edge of the <unk> .
well , unfortunately , unfortunately , we see more of this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it as the &quot; life in life , &quot; i &apos;m feeling bad . and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes .
that &apos;s me , i &apos;m doing that in life , i &apos;m doing bad <unk> .
this is a graffiti in my homeland in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , why we see in my ph.d. why we were better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in reality .
and i don &apos;t mean just fewer successful , though that &apos;s part of that .
we get into biopolymers more . i mean , in terms of motivation with the motivation , doing something inspired by collaboration with each other .
and if we &apos;re in a conversational situation , i think many of us are able to turn into our best version , anytime , immediately , to try to solve the problem , as long as they need to go back to the <unk> .
and in reality , when we &apos;re failing , when we come up with obstacles , we often feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed with us . we feel defeated us , and we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have those feelings when we play games play games , in play , just don &apos;t just play them .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to do as a phd student .
why is it impossible in games , thinking , well , you could not just achieve anything ?
so how can we transfer those feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment for the collaborative problem solving .
and i saw some things that technology <unk> in <unk> as possible .
so , first of all , if you come in one of these <unk> problems , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters who are willing to give you a fancy mission , and it &apos;s right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect at your state-of-the-art level in the game , right ?
so they &apos;re going to do this .
they never get a job they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , they have got to work . but there is no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you &apos;re <unk> , and there &apos;s always very specific target to do something significant .
and there are plenty of staff .
so where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them trying to finish their epic mission .
this is what we &apos;ve done in the real life is not so straightforward , that sense that there &apos;s a shortage of tons of sheep .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + a starches &quot; or &quot; + an intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in true life .
so when i come out of this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk , and + a crazy idea , like 20 20 crazy ideas .
i &apos;m not getting into the true life of this feedback .
so , the issue of life like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be at the edge of an orb web , that we rather spend all of our time in those cases .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
and today , all the world of <unk> together has spent millions of years trying to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it sounds nasty .
but to see it in context , <unk> million years ago started our first <unk> .
so the first continued primate .
ok , so , if we talk about how much time we spend playing games with games , it makes sense , when you look at the time in terms of scale of human evolution , what is extremely common .
but also , because it turns out , actually , because it turns out that we &apos;re using this stuff in play , and actually change what we &apos;re able to do as people are able to do it as people are able to .
we &apos;re developing ourselves , and we &apos;re developing human beings , and we &apos;re developing human beings .
this is the truth . i think that .
if you look at this interesting , interesting statistics , a researcher of carnegie mellon recently -- the average young man of today living in a country with severe <unk> to the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons , for two reasons .
first of all , kids in the usa are <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who you spend in school , from the fifth grade class to graduated from high school -- if you &apos;re never absent .
so , here we have a full <unk> model where young people are learning , what it means to be a good player , like everything else they &apos;re learning in school .
and perhaps some of you have the new book from malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you know your theory of success , the theory of the success of 10 hours .
it &apos;s based on the magnificent research research shows that if we deal with 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of any <unk> to the 21st century , we &apos;re going to end up with it .
we &apos;re going to do so well whatever it is to do , like the most vulnerable people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the gamers good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have the <unk> of human potential ever before .
so many people in the world are currently spending about an hour in the world who spend at least an hour every hour in the world .
these are our teammates , 500 million people , who are extraordinarily good in &quot; things . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have one billion players who are extraordinarily well in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
these <unk> <unk> , which energy and work at <unk> work , instead of trying to work around the world , especially in the world , especially in india , china , china , brazil can play .
you would expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
so we have a million billion player a total player .
so i started to think about what it is , what it is about to make these games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , <unk> .
ok , so think of it as an extreme weather solution .
<unk> , the desire to do something to do a challenge , together with belief that we have an educated hope of success .
always believe that a <unk> victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worthwhile to try and do it in the same way .
players don &apos;t sit around .
compulsive are experts in the spiders <unk> social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like when we &apos;ve played with them , even though they &apos;ve played our minds , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it takes a lot of faith to play with someone playing a game .
we believe that there &apos;s a lot of time when the rules are going to make the rules that we &apos;re going to do , that we have the same goal , and yet to go to the <unk> .
so the <unk> is able to grow from drawing , trust and one .
as a result of it , we build more complex social relationships .
productivity productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why i think the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , like <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier , working hard work when we swat ourselves or do nothing .
we know that we work as a human being as human beings , when we do hard , grand work done .
and the players are always willing to work hard when they &apos;re getting the right thing .
and ultimately , epic significance .
players love to be the part of the awe of the <unk> quake .
there &apos;s a line to bring that into perspective on the right light . you know all about wikipedia , the grandest thing in the world .
the second largest leash in the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than about any other <unk> in the world than any other <unk> in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they think they can change as individuals .
and the only thing is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to jehovah jehovah from a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> worlds . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i -- i develop play , i &apos;m kind of <unk> .
so he says , actually , this makes sense , because players can reach more than real life in the real life .
you can attach more complex social ties in games than real life . you get more feedback and reward games than in games than in real life .
so , he says , well , it &apos;s totally logical , that gamers are more of the time in the virtual world than in the real time .
i just agree that it &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to begin transforming the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years <unk> .
and there are these ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and these were kind of the first of people used to develop the first of people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek greek <unk> <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games have been invented .
according to <unk> , games became a little bit more <unk> , in the kingdom of famine while a famine invented during famine famine .
well , there was such a big famine , that the king of europe took himself into a crazy idea .
people suffered suffered . people struggle .
it was an ultimate situation . it needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , in fact , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> a national strategy , on a day you would eat , you would play .
and they would be so very ingrained in the deep dives , because games are so intriguing , and swat us out with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play , and the next day you would eat .
and on <unk> , they survived for me as 18 years as they were working on a day and they played on the next day .
so , i think today , i think we &apos;ll play games today .
we put play games to get the suffering from the real world .
we &apos;re creating games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , especially life in real life , and we &apos;re bringing ourselves what we need to play from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years of famine , famine failed is not better . so the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two .
they were playing a <unk> , and they were allowed to participate in a <unk> adventure .
they took <unk> and they went to look for a new home , so they had a lot of people left out of food , and they were looking for the rest of a neighborhood they were able to survive .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but latest research shows that the gamma bands , which later makes the fall apart from the old empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
and so , scientists finally came to the notion that <unk> / mad story is true .
and geologists found evidence of a global flu company that lasted almost 20 years of famine .
so this crazy thing could be true .
in fact , they have saved their people through games , by <unk> , for 18 years in games , and then they had these meetings and so much about playing with each other , they could have saved the entire civilization of civilization .
so , we can also do that .
we play since 1994 food .
and that was the first <unk> in real time in the world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
they played <unk> for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing out since 16 years of warcraft .
i want to suggest , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent out half of their civilization to look for a new world , so i guess my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should be doing that , half of us spend an hour of play a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and so on this question i dedicated my work on the last few years at the institute .
we &apos;ve got this banner from our office in palo alto , in palo alto , it covers out how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to introduce the best results , and then people want to empower this idea of reality .
we put some technology ahead in front of us , and we give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i designed to try to do , <unk> people in your own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> period where you have to walk through a <unk> period .
the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve stockpiled enough for it , and you actually have to live with it a real life . so , if you &apos;re going to go out into the game , please tell us how much oil is it . and then you ask them to do whatever it is .
we &apos;ve been tested at 100,000 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been covering it since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an ecstatic experience .
nobody wants to change his life , because it is good for the environment or because we should .
but if they &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out the oil . &quot;
this is a very intriguing adventure you &apos;re about .
find out what they would survive , and most of our players have the actual <unk> habits .
so , for the next large-scale game , we have a bigger , higher goal than than just screwing together .
we &apos;ve created a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; at the institute for the future .
it &apos;s the kind of calculation that people have left to have left only 23 years on the planet left .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global warming <unk> , &quot; of course .
so the call on a player dedicated to sign , we &apos;ve moved almost like a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s the &quot; <unk> . &quot; they have the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , the scientists , and they can only save them together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the business business , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played this game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can &apos;t read when they google &quot; google &quot; .
and the last game we pick up on the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world leaders .
so , when you finish the game , you get the honor from the world world leaders , graduated from 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all across sub-saharan africa and invite them to learn social essential .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high school , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , vision and ingenuity .
so i &apos;d like to share with you all this game with young people all around the world , especially in the world , especially in <unk> , who is going to come up with their own social companies to save the world .
so i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think , is going to happen next ?
we have these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you &apos;ll agree with me that the gamers are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for changes .
we have these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to attach deeply social social networks , <unk> and yearning for yearning matter .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing together with major games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me playing games like this and play .
now , if i fast-forward to the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things that we can make every <unk> future , and we can play all sorts of games .
so , i say , well , let &apos;s start the <unk> game .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about a couple of months ago writing a piece on <unk> magazine .
i always put my snorkel on my book , right , but i was able to work with the copy of the texts , and i realized that i had never been dived in my life , which is the word &quot; chopsticks . &quot;
i &apos;m going to tell you the point .
&quot; chopsticks , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong strong factors . &quot;
so , i read this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i only came up with &quot; chopsticks &quot; and didn &apos;t have to quit it , and i had to stop reading , and first of all , <unk> emotional shock .
of course , it was a <unk> old <unk> rusty , and i just thought that the implications had to be pretty old .
but actually , there was a copy on the early 1980s , when i just started with the elementary school and started to build my family circle outside of my family and form , as well as other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and , thank god , i didn &apos;t use a product at that time .
i &apos;m going to take this particular serious picture , i &apos;d born into a world that someone feels like me as a person whose life can &apos;t be positive in any way . but today , i &apos;m going to participate for the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately took the ceo of 2009 to me , and i think i find a <unk> piece here .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> version .
unfortunately , she isn &apos;t much better .
specifically , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; called &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with those words .
it &apos;s about the values that in these words , and how we build these values .
our language interferes with our minds and how we see the world around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that , indeed , they &apos;ve got a big force of a strong force because what you think is loud .
so , what do we actually want to talk about -- one disabled person or a healthy people ?
just to mention people as a kid to say , well , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> and they &apos;re imagination .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a person who has opened up for me was my pediatrician on the <unk> institute in <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> whose name you can think most americans couldn &apos;t , and so , he was always dr. p. <unk> .
and dr. p. used to have a very colorful <unk> , and it was done for children just like created .
i found the time i was living in this hospital , just fantastic -- until my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t have to repeat an awful lot of time with those fluffy , elastic <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my shells , and i hated those tape anymore . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even negotiate talking as a respectful child with dr. p. and trying to stop those practices , <unk> with success .
and one day he noticed in one of my studies -- these exercise were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a big , strong and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of those tape .
and if you make it , let me give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
and of course , this was just a very simple trick by dr. p. , making the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do , with the possibility that <unk> babies in the hospital in the second floor , but he has actually helped me to see my daily <unk> with new eyes , so became a new and disruptive experience .
and i wonder how much his vision of me is as strong and <unk> young girls shaped my sense of self , and i could think of as as nature from strong , healthy and healthy human being .
so , this is just one example of many , like adults are able to invent the imagination of a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the most pointed out in <unk> examples , our language doesn &apos;t make room to imagine anything that we would all want to aspire to , to see ourselves as healthy people to see themselves as healthy people .
so our language language <unk> the social change , which has triggered in many ways through a technical change .
now , of course , from the great point of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the eruptions of <unk> , <unk> from titanium and synthetic bodies for the greater body that allowed people to use properly .
so perhaps there &apos;s this technical change in this technology , because every one of the other things , namely , that every human society can do something very powerfully and very powerfully , and the human ability to adapt , to fit , is our greatest plus .
so , the human ability -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about what i &apos;m talking about , and i &apos;m going to tell you something about this formula for me , and i always felt very uncomfortable with people asking people to answer people &apos;s questions , and i think i can &apos;t understand why .
so , this line of <unk> lives on the idea that success or luck of it depends on trying to determine a challenge with it , and as if my life is so successful , as if my life could be as successful as it could be , because i could detect the possible thing of life with a prosthetic arm , or whatever people with my disability .
but the reality is that we change . of course , of course , we &apos;re faced by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally , or even both of these things is true .
and i want to suggest that it is good .
empiricism is no obstacle that we need to get <unk> to make our life better clear .
<unk> is just about to our lives .
and i tend to look at mines as seen as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s very , very hard to see , but he is constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to deprive the effect of the impact on a human <unk> &apos;s face .
there are <unk> and challenges in life and challenges , and these are just <unk> real , and every person wants to come with it , and the question is , if we deal with <unk> <unk> or not , but as we get out of it .
so , we &apos;re not only responsible for keeping people who we adore , but they prepare for it to make good sense of it .
and we don &apos;t change our kids when we give them the sense they don &apos;t change .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things out there : to be one of the medical fact about being true , and for the other social mind about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability , who i had to put myself apart , is that the world is going through , you could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at heart , and we have the cold , hard truth about their medical grant , or even a grant to the quality of life that they expect , we &apos;ve got to make sure that someone is actually disabled .
and perhaps the concept , which is just paying attention to what is broken on , and how we fix it , for every one of them , is a major disability as the pathology labs .
if we don &apos;t treat people holistically holistically , and not all of its forces and the options and the options , we can create in addition to the natural struggle that they may have to lead , another disease .
we <unk> a person who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> and look at all the human possibilities of human possibilities .
but what &apos;s most important is that between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , there &apos;s a connection between our <unk> and our great <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t dismiss those <unk> times , or perhaps , we should not try to avoid them , we should not try them among the rug , but it &apos;s about to see in the most degrading opportunities .
it may be more important to me , realizing that we don &apos;t necessarily have to go through <unk> , but we &apos;re willing to take it out , embrace it , <unk> it to take a nap , and perhaps even dancing with it .
and perhaps we can create it , as a matter of natural , <unk> and useful , and feel so abused through your presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 anniversary anniversary of charles darwin and when he blogged about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my mind , pointed in something really true in human characters .
so , i would use it : not the most powerful of its species , and not the <unk> of his species , but it can adapt to the edges of change in the best way .
conflict creates creativity creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and <unk> , the struggle of the human mind is determined to turn through conflict .
so , once again , change and adaptations are the greatest human being .
and perhaps we don &apos;t even know what the timber is from , if we &apos;re actually <unk> .
possibly in the sense of <unk> , a notion of <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something for ourselves .
we can make a new meaning , which is beyond severe times .
perhaps , perhaps we can see eruptions as change as change .
<unk> stands for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet yet .
i think the biggest thing that we have done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal normal .
there &apos;s usual . it &apos;s the typical . but not that normal , and they would like to learn this poor , gray person really , if they were really going to learn from it ?
i think rather not .
it would be great if we could not yet adapt to this paradigm or from the strength to make it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can create the forces of very many children , and they &apos;re willing to release their very special and valuable levels in society .
<unk> found out that we used to have human beings from the members of our society , to be able to be useful to be useful and to do a piece .
there &apos;s been evidence that already , the neanderthals have 60,000 years ago , old people with severe severe injuries , and it might be , because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of these people was valuable for society .
they hadn &apos;t seen these people as <unk> and <unk> ; they were treated as something were valued and valued .
a few years ago , i went into the city , which i was growing up in a central park in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summertime , and i had <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this old man , and i had no idea who he is .
and i thought , &quot; excuse me , sir , do we know ? i cannot remember it . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you hardly remember me .
when i first saw her , i got her from her mother &apos;s gut . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it has <unk> .
that was dr. <unk> , a man who knew i only knew stories of my mother about that day , because of course , being typical , leads to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnosis my mom was on vacation , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world , even at all .
and because i was born with no <unk> , and my feet went to them , and i only had a bunch of toes on this and had a bunch of toes on the other side of it , he had to bring the worse news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say to myself , &quot; i must say your parents must never walk and be as <unk> as other kids , or that you could never have a self-sufficient life , and then they have me simply lying . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had accumulated <unk> in my entire childhood <unk> in the second class in the second grade , if i had to go with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , didn &apos;t matter whether i was my scholarship or one of my sport <unk> <unk> , and he used these little snippets to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the x <unk> , the potential of human willing .
you can &apos;t just point out enough to determine how critical this factor for the quality of life can be .
and dr. <unk> continues to tell , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t usually receive something else , and also if they get a little bit of help themselves , they can reach a lot . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody with it , are two different things .
and i didn &apos;t have changed in time when they had spent 15 years old in the age of 15 years old , if i had my <unk> <unk> legs out of flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have a second card .
i didn &apos;t want to be normal in the back of the normal normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i have seen something with my legs and not in spite of this experience .
and perhaps this change could happen because i &apos;ve walked so many people who &apos;ve opened doors , instead of people who wanted to see me , who wanted me to become a picture of people who wanted me to become an idea .
look , it &apos;s really just a people who makes them demonstrate how they can control their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you &apos;re allowing someone to activating your own inner forces , the human mind is so noisy -- and if you can do it , and for someone in a big bang , you &apos;re opening a very good teacher for these people .
they teach them to open doors to open doors .
and the actual significance of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; goes back in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that exists in one is , the potential .
and again , what &apos;s potential for us to do now , because now ?
in the 1960s , in britain was done by a study of study , and then <unk> were converted into fungal production .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
students are divided by grades .
and a student , <unk> <unk> , get the better teachers , get the better teachers , etc .
they &apos;ve done over a <unk> period of student students with a &quot; enough &quot; -- they told them they were super smart , they were super smart , and they were super smart , and after these three months they were really optimistic .
and , of course , it turns out to hear the heart , that <unk> said , they were only enough .
and it was also about the three months later .
but just those who were still in school -- except for the students who were going to drop the school .
very importantly , the teacher was not <unk> .
the teachers did not know something changed .
they just said to them that they were the <unk> , and they &apos;re the students with the note enough , and they &apos;ve also taught them to do something about them , and they &apos;re treated with them .
so , the only real disability is a <unk> belief system , which has no hope ; there &apos;s no hope anymore , it lacks our natural ability , <unk> <unk> and our basic ability of imagination .
but if we manage to encourage the human spirit , to hope , and other people around themselves , being beautiful and other people around them , and then we put our forces really positively positive .
if a spirit of those qualities , we can create a new reality and new organizational models .
so , i &apos;d like to end by poem by an persian poet named <unk> in the 14th century , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words . &quot;
come here , dance with me . thanks very much .
how would they want to be better than they are right now ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory of your genes -- more precise , and faster and faster .
or want to be more powerful , more powerful , more force .
do you want more and more confident ?
what would it be like to live in good health ?
or perhaps , they &apos;re one of those things that always goes into more creativity .
what would you like most like ?
what would you like to have , if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many people there are creative people there .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose for a good mind ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do as a doctor .
if you could only one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it just a conceit ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a <unk> issue on the ted conference , but today i want to suggest a doctor &apos;s mind .
the big emphasis in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology , doesn &apos;t make sense of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t adopt the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good point of view , taking rid of your personal life -- i &apos;m going to give you permission -- and perhaps , you know , <unk> <unk> &apos; book , &quot; because there &apos;s no way to do this talk .
but if you accept organic evolution , you think about the past , or is it about the past , or is it going to be about the future ?
it &apos;s for other memorials , or are it talking about it ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush in the middle of all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing <unk> on the tips of those branches in evolutionary terms , they have survive ; it &apos;s maintained for its surroundings and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , obviously , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re twigs from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there might be 20 or 25 different kinds of hominids about hominids .
some of them went and walked .
we &apos;ve been there for about <unk> years .
it feels like we &apos;re right remote from the other part of the tree of life , but actually , for the largest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are fairly equal to our cells .
is it sure that we can take advantage of that , and create the mechanisms of a common bacteria <unk> to create the protein of human dna , which is used to treat the blood of the human genome , which is used to treat blood pressure ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein , which is chemically <unk> from what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about is conscious , is that everybody from us in our gut more bacteria than it takes more bacteria than it leads to the rest of our bodies ?
perhaps 10 times many times .
i mean , think of it , when antonio damasio thinks about your sense of view , do you think about bacteria ?
our gut is a beautiful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give them all the nutrition that they could only add without effort to them .
it &apos;s actually a lighter way for bacteria , with occasional <unk> of unintended consequences , <unk> <unk> .
but , you know , they &apos;re a beautiful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help from essential nutritional food , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> state in the form of a species ?
or are we designed to become something different -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , go back to the era of the big bang at 14 billion years ago -- the solar system , on about four billion years ago -- the first evidence of organisms -- perhaps three or four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms , perhaps as a 800 or a billion years ago .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth only briefly ; the animal kingdom , like a single imitation , and of the human life , is a little <unk> .
these were us .
so this is also the <unk> of this speech , which is why i hope , <unk> , it has dropped to it .
well , when i was a college student at college , i had my first sabbatical .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental , which is , most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information from the cell is going on in both hemispheres .
but at the time , when <unk> organisms began to change things , things begin to change things .
sexual reproduction starts in the picture .
and , importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will grow , it will satisfy the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the death of death of the death penalty death at the same time in evolution at the same time as well as sexual reproduction .
now , i have to say , when i was a <unk> , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty well at the time , but with every year , it has occurred to my increased belief .
i was able to understand the feelings from george burns , who was in vegas houses his show in the 1990s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hindquarters .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s got a wonderful <unk> in front of him .
and she looked at him and says , &quot; i am here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
and i came to the conclusion as a doctor , i was trying to make a target , as the goal of evolution -- not necessarily odds , just differently .
i tried trying to keep the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to try to restore health to a disease .
i wanted we to live a long and to live healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome on the next generation , <unk> and recovery generation generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re using it , and i like <unk> rockets , to send out the genetic <unk> into the next level of space , and then let &apos;s shut down into the sea .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody allen <unk> everyone , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want immortality to come through my work .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
evolution does not necessarily seem to encourage the longest life .
it &apos;s not inevitable , but it &apos;s not even the big one , but it &apos;s not even the brightest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are adapted on the environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
and on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are sitting there , and they &apos;re missing in it , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum supply , they would have been able to go there , they would have been able to make a <unk> environment for themselves .
so , what does this mean when we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of evolution , and especially as we go into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to make us progress .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that is that it would be due to us by medicine , and managed to get a lot of genes that would have otherwise been derived from the population , from the population that would be obtained from the population .
and second , we as a species have evolved our environment so that we have been able to believe that they adapt to us .
and by the way , we &apos;re moving and round and create so much so much that they can &apos;t say that they can &apos;t say that recovery is necessary , for evolution , for centuries .
one second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional way , of course , imposed from nature of nature .
and the argument , though , is that the wheels of evolution are slowly <unk> , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far from our isolation , if we colonize and colonize as a species , it will be insulation and the changes of environment can make sense of natural practice in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way to get a <unk> , intriguing and terrifying possibility possibility to be a third way .
i call it <unk> , the new development which is not just natural , but selected by us as the <unk> in the decisions we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we could do this ?
if we look at the reality that people today , in certain cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so if you think , you know , if it &apos;s not allowed to be able to choose your child &apos;s sex , but also on the body of genetic adaptations , the diseases would be able to cure disease and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes , to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease , or eliminating the risk of death , or <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to be able to make those changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re <unk> , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> billion dollars .
in subsequent year , when it was completed in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in <unk> until four months .
now , you can see a sequence of the three billion base pairs of human genome on a cost of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it won &apos;t take longer for a long time until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available to everyone .
in front of a week , convicted of the national academy of engineering presented the <unk> prize for francis arnold and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , independently evolved to work faster on the natural process of evolution .
in front of a few years ago , enrico fermi scientists was lent to his research on his specialty , a sleek , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell induced pluripotent genes to become an alternate stem cell inside of your body .
these changes are in place .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that can &apos;t just serve themselves , but can also serve the germs of other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it is an experimental study in the gang of vaccine vaccine with vaccine cancer in the cells of a vaccine production .
can you think of a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
so this is all truth and in the future will be much more likely to be done .
so imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could alter the <unk> and <unk> or the newly scary egg , so to give your children a better chance of life , eliminating the diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technique , the same motor of scientific engineering can allow for the change to prevent disease , we could also adopt ourselves to adopt the <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the <unk> of a ken <unk> <unk> , especially if you can add it to the next generation ?
why don &apos;t they have fast policies that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer life ?
these will be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we &apos;re going to adopt , we &apos;re going to be converted from mindless evolution to <unk> evolution .
we will have a process which generally takes 100,000 years , and we can compress it down a thousand years -- and perhaps the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , need to be obtained .
do we use those decisions to shape society , which is better , the more prosperous , is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us , and not for others ?
will we make a society form <unk> and <unk> , or more robust and redistribute ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
and on top of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom we will need to make those decisions that we need to make these decisions ?
in the good words of evil , and maybe as you think , these decisions are about us .
thank you .
so i want you to imagine something , a portable robots that gives you <unk> capabilities , or another , the <unk> device that helps you to stand up and go again .
now , in berkeley , we call <unk> these robots <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing other than something they put in the morning , and they give them extra starches , and they will continue to improve their speed .
this is actually the true of human beings and machine .
but it &apos;s not just that -- join together and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re going to start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on his backs , and there &apos;s a query for that .
and of course , there leads to some key complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so what we thought was that we would think of this challenge , and we would think of it as a challenge to deal with this problem with this problem .
so now , let me introduce you now to <unk> -- or human universal <unk> <unk> .
rb : with the <unk> , i can wear 200 pounds about <unk> terrain terrain , for many hours .
so flexible design enables it to propagate itself deep , using highly skilled movements .
it feels what i want to do , which i want to go , and then my starches and stamina .
we &apos;re at this stage with our favorite device , this new <unk> device in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so , let &apos;s now look at the people with the people , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there &apos;s 68 million people globally sitting around the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and this is actually a conservative estimates .
we often talk about a very young person with spinal cord injury , which in the height of their lives -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population , whose number are multiplying .
and so the only option -- if it comes to a cassowary , or by other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since his , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so , we thought that we could begin to make a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
now , let me introduce you to <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> years ago , who suffered a <unk> period that they did not have been performed for years of years , and yet .
thanks very much .
as i said , amanda is our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his latest see-through sensors on the artic , from interpreting the signals at our fingertips , who hangs on her back , is attached to her .
so here &apos;s also <unk> , and the <unk> is on his hips , as well as their <unk> , they &apos;re moving forward to this kind of <unk> and a natural way .
i was 24 years old , and i was in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk> myself .
in the <unk> of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement under my <unk> .
not as long afterwards as a doctor in my <unk> and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and it was 19 years ago .
he stole every fresh hope of hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have taken me out of <unk> , learning , <unk> <unk> , and even riding with the hands of the hands .
but there &apos;s nothing invented that would let me go again until now .
thank you very much .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to come together and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the potential to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , for all of the people , but all the people , but all of them .
thank you very much .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss from <unk> of a nonprofit <unk> organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get out of poverty , i &apos;m <unk> by a <unk> of a volunteer in a volunteer <unk> on the fire .
now , in our city , in fact , volunteers have an <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ve got to be pretty early on the <unk> , to be able to <unk> <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on the <unk> , so i had a pretty good chance of getting into it .
but it was still a race of race against the other volunteers trying to get out of the people who were going to do what our job was going to be .
and when i found the <unk> , he had a very serious conversation with the <unk> , who had certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and it stood in the <unk> and <unk> under a <unk> abandoned rain while her house was burned .
the other volunteers , the slightly before me , had to call it -- let &apos;s call it <unk> luther -- got to be asked by the <unk> and was asked to go into the dog and rescue the dog &apos;s dog .
dog ! i was stunned by the heart .
there were any lawyer or <unk> , who could now talk for the rest of his life , the people who went into a windowless house to rescue a living thing , only because it was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> myself .
he said , &quot; parting , you need to go into that house .
you have to go up to the top where the fire is going to end up , and you need to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i &apos;m coloring it .
now , not exactly what i had , but i went down -- the stairs went down , the hallway walking down the hallway , at the same time , the real &quot; <unk> &quot; by which they were able to get out of the bedroom with a pair of shoes .
i know what you think now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i wore my geometry back down , where i met my <unk> and <unk> my dog .
we put our treasures out in <unk> , where , no surprisingly , his substantially more attention got more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the <unk> received a letter of the <unk> , which she expressed for the brave use of her house .
and one of the most commonly valued kindness kindness : someone got a pair of shoes .
both in my career from robin hood , as a volunteer , as an iranian fireman , i &apos;m observing by generosity and kindness on the big scale , but i also see also acts of kindness and <unk> of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this in this room and see people who are either going to have an unfortunate success or they &apos;re going to go there , i want to offer this memory message : they &apos;re not waiting for it .
they &apos;re not trying to make a difference in the life of one another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something , you &apos;ll give it right now .
use it in a <unk> park , and you apply a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day a chance will offer us a chance to save life &apos;s life , but every day will give us the opportunity to change one .
so they &apos;re going on , save the shoes .
thanks very much .
bruno <unk> : mark , oh , come back .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to go back from a community standpoint who knows the secret of humanity .
one place where the women have the <unk> , with sex &apos; saying , &apos; saying , &quot; where &apos;s the game -- where there &apos;s a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the <unk> of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our closest living relative .
that means , we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimps are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect narrative in the history of human evolution .
but also , let &apos;s show the other side of the mountain .
as chimps , dread <unk> , <unk> <unk> , will be ruled by <unk> female female <unk> .
they &apos;ve actually come up with this , because this leads into a very mild society that has been seen not seen by the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least <unk> among the primates .
they &apos;re living into the depths of the <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;re only really deeply accessible to the observation .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of remarkable biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the dark themselves -- the setting of a violent struggle , has been taken for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it was not surprising that these destruction is also the survival of the fittest .
and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , you can &apos;t even fill with the <unk> bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country from violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> laugh that affect the trees .
who are these relationships ?
we &apos;ve known as &quot; love instead of war instead of war , because they have <unk> sex , with <unk> mates , with <unk> partners , and rules so conflicts and social dilemmas .
i &apos;m not saying that the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the life of the bonobos are made out of more than the <unk> <unk> .
bonobos -- like people -- like people -- you love playing your life .
play doesn &apos;t just mean <unk> .
for us , play is essential for the connection of relationships and the nurturing of the tolerance .
we &apos;re learning about that , and the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about biodiversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of interactions , diversity of culture , diversity of compounds .
and if you look closely at play , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and rituals .
play is the most important thing we <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique images right from the wilderness .
first of all , a <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think of <unk> .
so here we see a young female and a male <unk> .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolution of this : &quot; she touches him with the eggs . &quot;
just that , i think it sounds more like it , not true .
yeah !
so <unk> is spreading both around with people as well as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it demonstrates -- and this video is really interesting , because it captures the landscape of creativity with which you create new elements -- as the testicles -- and also , how to make both sense of hope .
but the game is a game-changer .
play is a <unk> thing , and it can adopt many shapes who are some kind of quiet , <unk> , curious -- perhaps to explore the villagers again .
and i would like to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and they &apos;re playing with water with water .
i think just as you play it alone , and we have <unk> limitations of our interior and exterior worlds .
and it &apos;s the kind of playful curiosity that makes us explore and interact with us , and the unexpected brain that we create is the real ground of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> response to the insights , which is <unk> us in our past and present .
but it also demonstrates a secret for our future , a future that we have faced with severe challenges , among greater creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the mysteries is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our lifeblood .
in order to fit successful in a <unk> world , we have to play play .
but are we going to make the best out of our <unk> ?
play isn &apos;t silly .
but it &apos;s critical .
for birds , and people equally , life is not made out of teeth and steal alone .
now , if it doesn &apos;t seem salt at it , maybe play is <unk> .
and therefore , my ignorant , let &apos;s play this gift of evolution and play , as we play creativity and wonder .
thank you .
so , i want you to imagine two couples , in middle 1979 , on the same day , exactly the same day , each <unk> a baby -- ok .
so two couples , each <unk> a baby .
now i don &apos;t want too much time to imagine the <unk> , because , if you look at the <unk> <unk> , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that for a moment .
and in this case , you &apos;ll imagine that , in a case , the sperm wears a y <unk> , hitting the x chromosome on the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the boat is producing x chromosome that &apos;s hitting x chromosome on the x chromosome .
both of them are <unk> , both light fires .
we come back later on these people .
most of my activities in most of my activities , i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studying <unk> , and in this case , i &apos;m studying how people anatomy anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- like they &apos;re interacting with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , as they think about bodies , as they think about bodies .
the other hat i have carried up with my work , is the activist , as <unk> -- or , as i say , as a impatients advocate -- from people , the patients of doctors are the patients of doctors .
in the case , i worked with people who have been working with people who are asking social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people , the <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with <unk> worked -- so people who are being used as usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with psychotic people whose gender <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different shapes .
i just give you a bunch of examples from the possible guys from <unk> who &apos;s not the male or female standards .
in one case , you might draw someone with a maverick <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> , the <unk> gene , the <unk> gene , who we have at the beginning of <unk> , are growing bullets .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are in the <unk> stage testosterone .
but because the receptors is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so a lot testosterone , but no response to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more into the typical female region .
if the child gets born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s resigned as girls .
but it takes the most time to grow and grow your breasts and develop breasts , but they don &apos;t get her period , until someone else &apos;s going to come up with something else .
and they &apos;re doing a bunch of tests , and they find out that they were rather <unk> and krill , in reality , in reality , in fact , that they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s really important to understand that you could actually keep that person for fact , but they &apos;re not really true .
women , like men , have something called in our bodies , something called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the hind part of our bodies .
and the <unk> make <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual career , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like i actually speak on <unk> .
we &apos;re producing <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
the implication is that someone like i actually have a brain to actually have a brain that was born with mustaches , as a woman who was born with balls were born with balls .
so , sex is really complicated ; <unk> are not only in the middle of the spectrum of sex -- in particular , you can be spread across the entire network .
another few years ago , i received the phone call a guy named a guy who was born as a boy , he had a boyfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had figured out that he had a phantom arm , and he had a womb .
he had an extreme form of a natural response .
he &apos;s got <unk> chromosomes , and in the womb , his <unk> were so potent that they had created a juvenile <unk> that they were basically creating a juvenile <unk> .
and as a consequence of his <unk> called his <unk> male , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male part of the brain .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew something .
and only when he was approaching the age of 19 , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he had found the doctors inside , that the doctors had found that he was in the inner female .
ok , for example , a quick example of <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , develop something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t really know why this is happening .
so , sex can occur in many different ways .
and the reason why children with this kind of body -- it was <unk> , or <unk> twins , it turns out -- from surgeons very often to be adapted to the norm , is not because it would be a physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they often do different kinds of surgical interventions , because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system based on the idea that there &apos;s particular characteristics with a particular identity with a particular identity .
so , we have the idea that a woman is being asked to have a female identity , a black person , is meant to have a african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this incredibly terrifying idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body , which is actually something very different for us , which is confused by these <unk> .
so , we have a lot of radical ideas in our culture of romantic ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept from <unk> .
now you can imagine what it is , as it is , when children are born , that two people are born in a body .
now , where i had seen most of the time in the last day , the <unk> federation <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender in the world was asked by the <unk> world in berlin .
a lot of journalists call me the question : &quot; what test you will do , which tells us if <unk> is female <unk> female or a male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalist that i didn &apos;t have this test .
we now know that gender complicated enough is that we have to admit that the nature for us is not dividing line between the male and female and female and <unk> ; we &apos;re gonna find those together as natural as of course .
so we have a situation where , where , instead of accelerating our science , we have to have more to say that these categories , which we &apos;ve delivered for stable balls , which are a very simple cost-benefit analysis to create permanent <unk> , much more <unk> than we &apos;ve been accepted .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out as a lot more complicated than our <unk> .
in our <unk> , we get into all kinds of <unk> areas .
for example , we leads to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we can &apos;t tell ourselves from a few <unk> ?
as we push our science increasingly further forward , we get increasingly into a zone of <unk> , where we have to recognize the <unk> categories , which we had probably too simple .
we see that in all kinds of different places of human life .
one of the things we &apos;re seeing in the world is what we &apos;re seeing today , in our present-day culture , in the united states today , is the struggle at the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a human being , so that he &apos;s going to be a different kind of thing as this kind of thing .
we &apos;ve got very hard working these days -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had that hard time to fight when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve had a phantom limb for someone else &apos;s nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if they moved no longer , they have buried it .
but today , we &apos;re in a situation where we take people out of a situation where we take people out of slavery , and they want to take place to other people .
and as a consequence , we got caught in the struggle with the most difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have that kind of easy categories of things earlier .
now , you might suspect that the whole thing about categories of categories were someone who would really make me happy .
i am political <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to begin that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , get tense .
and it makes me feel uncomfortable about democracy in terms of democracy .
so to tell you about that <unk> , i first got to go beyond that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
so , i think they were so hot , and so radical , and so radical , in what they were doing , i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s about what <unk> has done with the <unk> .
the spanish from my view was the original tribal activists , and that &apos;s why .
what they were <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they were replacing it by another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us were civilians .
and as you all remember , our obama did the concept of the monarchy , and the renaissance was based on a very appealing idea of anatomy .
the <unk> of the ancient world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept concept system .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have political power , because of the <unk> <unk> of grandfather &apos;s grandfather and whatnot .
the <unk> meadows and they were <unk> this idea , and they replaced it by a new <unk> concept , and this idea said that everyone was created equal .
they <unk> the playing field , and they decided that <unk> saw the similarities , the similarities counted , not the differences . and it was very radical .
now , they took this part because they were part of a <unk> system in which two things in common with two things in common .
democracy grew , but at the same time , the science also grew .
if you look at the history of the obama &apos;s story , very clear many of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a central world .
they went away from shy , <unk> things , like a supernatural idea of power , back where the transmission on a very <unk> concept from <unk> .
they moved towards an ecstatic concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , they &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
they &apos;re talking about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they gave us a concept of <unk> similarities .
and so , you &apos;ve prepared for the future of rights leadership .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what went ahead ?
so , for example , women who <unk> <unk> , the concept of feminism , the concept of feminism , as the friendship difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utero and <unk> . &quot;
and women <unk> successfully .
and next came the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who cares about , &quot; am i not woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> line of <unk> phrases , saying , &quot; i am a man . &quot;
again , people of different color color , who are mixed with both skilled similarities in <unk> differences , again , successfully .
we see the same with the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at the similarities , we have to begin to ask in question why we maintain certain education systems .
well , mind you , i want to maintain particular <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t like to give a fish to the same rights as a people .
i don &apos;t want to say we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> is going to be right , trying to give sex consent to sex pain , to get married .
so there &apos;s some kind of serendipity that make me make sense of me , and that we think , i think , should .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them and they &apos;re useful .
so , let &apos;s come back to those two creatures that are <unk> at the beginning of the speech .
and we have two profiles , both in middle 1979 on the same day .
so , imagine that one of them , maria , three months <unk> , so she &apos;s born on june one june 1980 .
<unk> , on the other hand , is born for <unk> , so he &apos;s born in 1980 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria &apos;s born three months from <unk> , they raised all sorts of rights three months from <unk> -- which is to choose correctly sex , to choose the right .
<unk> has to wait for all this , not because he has a different biological age , just because of the <unk> of his life .
we still find other people in terms of what their rights are .
<unk> , because you just say it &apos;s more male -- even though i haven &apos;t told them that it &apos;s more accurate , it &apos;s got to be moved now , which is what it doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , in all states , can &apos;t even detect the same law , the <unk> in all states , has to marry the right thing .
<unk> can be married in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states today .
so , we &apos;ve got these permanently <unk> categories in many ways , and we &apos;ve got these permanently <unk> and <unk> .
and for me , the question is , what are we going to do , because our science of doing so far in the domain of anatomy , is that we get a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to drop science , but at the same time , it feels like science does either .
so where do we go ?
it appears as if our culture is going to adopt a kind of pragmatic posture , &quot; well , we must pull somewhere somewhere somewhere , so we draw them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get caught in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at one point decided that , if you wanted to marry a man , you didn &apos;t have y chromosome , and one woman feels that you have a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people will not try to test people on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the story of the story .
when we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says , we should not ask people , &quot; by your color , but by the character of your character , &quot; judge your character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you tap people from your people because of your <unk> ?
i also want to suggest that i &apos;m not sure that we should be given rights in human rights , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden representations probably more likely than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i &apos;m probably known as some of the light <unk> , which is more intelligent , more and more vulnerable to your sexual relationships than some of your sexual relationships , as some <unk> that i know .
so how do we address the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and one part of myself , what if the contents of personality would be something that would be overactive in the future -- could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is what the united states is asking about questions of democracy .
in our effort around democracy , we made our effort properly well , and i think we would make our business work in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in the case , where a man who &apos;s attracted to other men , whose death is being delivered to other men , it &apos;s because they &apos;re willing to be willing to be able to participate in whatever case he wants to stay alive .
we don &apos;t exist in those kinds of states .
and i &apos;m happy to say that we can &apos;t have those states -- a surgeon who was talking about a few years ago , who had a couple of <unk> twins related to them , partly to make a name .
but as i sat down with him , and asked him why he had these interventions -- these were highly expensive surgeries -- in his country , these children were going to be treated very badly , and therefore , he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , do you know , &quot; well , do you have a political asylum rather than one operation to them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible ways to allow people to be who they are , without referring to the state to change the state .
so i think we must be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to suggest that i talked a lot about the fathers &apos; fathers .
and i want to think about what democracy might look like , or might have said , if we had more involved the welfare .
and i &apos;d like to say something radical is something that is radical , and i think there might be different kinds of insights that comes from different kinds of anatomy , which are different kinds of analyses .
since years , because i was interested in <unk> , i was interested in research in the field of research research .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways they operate and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from tribal studies is that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- tend to have complex social relationships and the caring for people who are vulnerable within the group of people who are vulnerable .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i asked myself , one of my favorite members of feminism , who was my feminism feminism on feminism -- thinking , as a feminist thing , it was still -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about <unk> about gender , which is why feminism is feminism .
but the more i thought about his question , so more , i thought that it might be something feminism in feminism .
this is supposed to be something , on average , as female brains &apos; brains &apos; brains &apos; brains &apos; brains , which makes us <unk> social relationships for <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for that matter .
so , where the founding fathers were extremely upset about how individuals could be protected by the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more moms in this concept , we can &apos;t just learn how to preserve , but how we can help with each other .
and perhaps , where we have to go into the future , if we have democracy about the anatomy of anatomy -- less about the individual bodies , thinking about identity , and more about relationships .
so that when we try as a people trying to make a <unk> bond , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it , too , to every chance to find a different kind of outfit , <unk> outfit , and last time too , and to photograph and <unk> .
but i buy nothing new .
i get all of my clothes from second hand on <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my childhood on the environment , and also my neighbors .
i &apos;m going to meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars serving a good thing ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes everybody buy in my own personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my body size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if everyone says yes , i feel like i won .
i &apos;ll come back on my suitcase and tell you what i wrote for the exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody bring in with me so many ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought with .
i brought along with seven pieces of underwear , and this is all .
<unk> for one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been allowed to suggest everything i wanted to do , which i might find , if i &apos;d just come up with <unk> springs .
and since they don &apos;t belong from me , as the woman sitting here at ted &apos;s underwear -- i mean , i found some things .
and i just want to show you my favorite spending for these week .
does it sound good ?
so while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons i &apos;m doing , believe it or not , from that <unk> perspective , i &apos;m learning nothing new to wear nothing new .
let &apos;s start by sunday .
i call the shining tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you can almost always look at 50 dollars for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including me , cost me about 55 , and it was the most expensive thing i did in this week all week .
monday : color is something that is powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible impossible , <unk> <unk> , when you &apos;re wearing <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re looking at other people .
tuesday : <unk> are totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time trying to try to try and adapt to it , and adapt to it at the same time .
just tell you who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it , they &apos;re going to appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i saw what i saw as though i could do it , or i saw them in her seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confident is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost certain .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good in something else , they probably got right .
i grew up with a mother who was teaching me day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to finish this short for you .
if you believe that it &apos;s inside the inside , there &apos;s a beautiful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t have .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone in this audience .
we &apos;re supposed to be able to fix everything we want .
thanks very much .
friday : a universal truth -- five words , golden <unk> fit in everything .
and ultimately , saturday : one of its unique , unique style of design , is a great way to tell the world about one another , without having to say a word .
and it was always <unk> me , and again , when i walked people on this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great talks about what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , that doesn &apos;t fit everything in my tiny suitcase suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate this all again again .
because the lesson that i try to learn for myself this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to make these things not emotionally <unk> , because in the end , there &apos;s always going to be another crazy legacy , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , waiting for me when i &apos;m a little bit of love in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everyone together .
i have something here i want to show you .
think of this as <unk> as flying <unk> .
this is what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i am very italian , and every young in italy , with this picture in his room , and the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something that was done in the last few decades .
so at a time , it was so that if they wanted to get a race race , they took their budget and put money on a good car and put a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you know , if you &apos;re going to have a race race , actually something like this -- something like this -- a few thousand sensors , the information from the car , that relay information from the car , that information touches on the system , and then they process and then use that car to transmit that car .
these would call them , in <unk> , a <unk> call .
and essentially , it is a system that is comprised of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> system .
now , what &apos;s interesting now is , is the beginning beginning to happen in our lives .
our towns , in the last few years , has equipped with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be free at the free .
and as computers in free , they begin to respond to other kinds of ways they are perceived and powered .
if we <unk> towns , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lived there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the gasoline emissions -- add up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the towns , it puts out all of these things and goes into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the piston , at moma later on , during the summer , organized organized .
it says &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as though every atom gets out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that &apos;s really what kind of radical is the interaction that we have with our environment .
in a way , almost as though the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo was shaped by the moses , he says he took the balloon at the end of the balloon -- in fact , you can still see a little bit left <unk> -- and said , &quot; dubbed , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment is beginning for the first time to begin to answer us .
i &apos;m going to show you just some examples -- again , with the idea of restoring our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is in fact one of the first of our labs .
it took about four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually used a new way of using the network , which has been used around the world -- this is a curable thing -- and shots and <unk> information from this network , which is going to be obtained by the operators .
the summer was a bit happier -- 2006 .
it was taken as a physicist in italy .
and some of you will remember it was when italy was done by france , and eventually <unk> , the <unk> .
and anyway , italy ended up in the end .
now , look at what happens on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
on the morning , in front of the game .
you see the timeline clock .
in the old days , people here , and there , and they are doing the phone calls and they move .
the game starts off -- silence .
france does a door . biochemist does a door .
<unk> , people will do a short call , go into toilet .
second <unk> . it &apos;s done by regular play .
first of all , second , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
in italy . yeah .
well , in that night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , everyone went into the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister of meeting at the same time .
and then everyone went down .
you see the picture of the place called <unk> , where , since the roman season , people wanted to go to celebrate a big party , and you see the key at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we could feel the city , in a way , like we couldn &apos;t do it a couple of years ago .
so , very quickly , another example of sense : this is not about people , but about things we use , it &apos;s about things we use and consume .
well , today , we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that gives you all the chips , made a guess of what a mac computer is about how they came together .
but we don &apos;t just know about where the things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the trash of the trash while through the system .
so we started with a few volunteers who have helped us , something more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they were going to see -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that were going to throw them out anyway .
then we have the little chips , the little token tags , the little brands glued on the trash and then we started tracking it .
here are the results we have right now .
from seattle , seattle ...
after one week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing , in fact , with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
but that &apos;s going to happen a lot of these things , complicated things , complicated things .
the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day that the cup that we throw away is not just disappears , that they &apos;re still disappears on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we don &apos;t throw away every day every day .
and if we &apos;re going to show people , we can drive behavior behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
so , my fellow in mit , <unk> <unk> , could you tell a lot more about that , and the many other wonderful things you could make with perceive , but i want to talk to the second part of our environment , and this is the <unk> of our environment .
and the first thing is something that we did in front of a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of view , who came to us and said that there &apos;s a beautiful tradition and <unk> of a beautiful tradition of water in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you link technology , new technology technology ?
and one of the ideas that went on in a <unk> <unk> was , imagine these tubes and valves , valves , valves that are open and close .
they &apos;re creating something like a giant oil spill out of water .
if these deletions <unk> , they can chase them on it , they can map patterns , images , text ads .
and you can look at him , and he &apos;s going to open up and open up to you , as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve presented the mayor <unk> .
it &apos;s very much like it .
and we got the assignment to designing a building on the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water <unk> .
the whole building was made from water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you &apos;re approaching it , it &apos;s going to open up and pop it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you &apos;re going down the syringes , then you can even lower the roof .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like this , you know , this time you get the roof , you get imagery of people who were there and they say , &quot; you &apos;ve ruined the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break down the buildings ; it &apos;s only so that architecture almost disappears .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person going on inside of what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i try to test the data on the test of the information , not being delivered .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you what one night was when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was even more fun during that night .
all of these kids from <unk> came to the buildings , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a buildings that would open up to them , but a building that had still breaks down and holes in water , you had to jump into the water , you had to jump into the water right now .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as a designer , we always think about how people use things that we do .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are being used and interacting with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the heat of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water , and the projection for it .
and this is what inspired us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine if these artists could really start to fly .
imagine if you could have little calving floating through the air , and each of them with a little bolt of light with <unk> light -- almost as a cloud that stretches through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a calving face , like the one they saw in the beginning of what they were seeing with others , completely fundamental in sync .
you can have that cloud .
you can have some kind of immersive display or display , like these -- a smooth formation of formation in two dimensions .
but irregular , but in three dimensions where what changed is , the light is not the styling of the <unk> .
you can play different kinds of play with different kinds of play .
imagine the screen could look at disparate patterns , or quantities , in different ways , in different ways .
but then , the only thing could be an 3d cloud of <unk> that you can , and moving through and moving through , which you can consider , which you can look at from many , many directions .
so here you see a real <unk> signature , which is how to make a <unk> ring of how to make a <unk> v .
if you turn on light , it looks like this . so it looks like we saw it earlier .
imagine that every person is regulated .
it could have every impulse going on , who comes from people , from the movements of people , from the movements of the people , or so on .
i want to show you something here for first .
we worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the best jazz legends of our time -- the <unk> on the metropolitan theater in new york and <unk> in california -- we took his movements in 3d to use it as a momentum .
here you see dancing dancing dancing dancing .
on the left-hand side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> feedbacks .
it &apos;s also a <unk> and a <unk> .
so that they can sense the movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once again , once we have all <unk> , they can play with each other and play with color change and play games .
we want to use this as a kind of pulse for the <unk> device .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so , the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re looking at from people to do something and changing the environment -- almost something like we call it , <unk> <unk> , like you &apos;re going to do it , but with a cloud .
imagine if anyone can give a small class for a discount .
i think that the remarkable thing about what happened last few years , the last few decades , is that we &apos;ve shifted from a physical world in a way that we &apos;ve shifted from a physical world in the world .
that &apos;s digitized everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible by the internet .
now , for the first time , we can go for the first time -- and the campaign obama has showed this -- we can shift from the digital world from the network of the networks to the natural world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s something built in the city .
but tomorrow , it allows us to think about the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to change the way we switch through the same world .
so the idea is that we actually actually take the people involved in those things they &apos;re doing things together , collective doing .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way , like a real cloud of a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of temperature .
it &apos;s an interactive feature in london , but with <unk> covers .
they can move inside and create different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at them at the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> 2012 and other parts , and it &apos;s as kind of the connect to community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something on top of it , you can go out like <unk> new <unk> .
you can see inside .
and kind of a digital night of the night -- but as a <unk> , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as a artist , as an artist , is very important .
by my work , i try to express ourselves that people are separated from nature , and everything relates to each other .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago at antarctica , where i saw my first sabbatical .
i saw myself <unk> awe .
my heart beats , i was ecstatic , as i was trying to grab my mind from me .
the calving shot around me almost 60 meters from the water , and i was able to just wonder that that was a snowflake on a new snowflake , year after year .
<unk> are born as a calf of a glacier or by breaking out out of <unk> .
each iceberg has his own personality personality .
they operate in distinct ways with their surroundings and their experiences .
and some of them who are clinging to the bitter end of the bitter end of the bitter end of it , as others can &apos;t stand more and more into a <unk> passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you &apos;re easy to think that you &apos;re isolated , separate and just , as you often see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg melting , i &apos;m going to put his carbon atmosphere out of it .
during the iceberg , he puts it out of <unk> drinking water , which creates a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to look at my photographs as being portraits of my ancestors , conscious of my ancestors that exist in those individual moments of these , and never going back that way .
it &apos;s not a death if it &apos;s melting ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s an <unk> of your <unk> running along the life cycle .
one part of the ice in the sky is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and one part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the latest images i &apos;d like to show you , show me a iceberg that i did in greenland in greenland .
and very importantly , you &apos;re actually going to witness a threshold of mental iceberg .
so here you see it .
on the left-hand side , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please pay attention to the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s located .
you can see here , he starts to turn on , and the boat has moved to the other side , the husband is there .
this is the average size of a mini marshmallow .
he reaches about dragging about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , you see this iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extremely blessed with the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on is this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most successful <unk> in the mid- &apos; 80s .
then , one day he came back from walk and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and it was the outbreak of it .
<unk> is totally paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was faced with him .
i have a company called the design and animations , so clearly a complex part of what we admire in the art world and pay attention to the art world .
so , we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and his cause to support his thing .
i met myself with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; well , do you know , &quot; i saw stephen hawking -- you can &apos;t memorize all the people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;re going to get more <unk> and have a trained insurance , you can actually do that .
ordinary people aren &apos;t these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterflies and <unk> ? &quot;
so they communicate -- that &apos;s how your fingers are running along .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; well , how can that be ? &quot;
so i got into the need for just a check , and instead i put a check out that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was going to make him <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go into place and place to his brother and his dad -- in the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this way : tony &apos;s going to show him a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that he can do his art again .
because it &apos;s a pat that someone who is carrying all of this is not able to communicate with it . &quot;
so i was talking about a few months later on a conference .
so , i met these people from <unk> , apples research research , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on every surface and then on a <unk> basis , which is only the negatives area .
so they &apos;re moving around and they &apos;re doing things like this .
they say that all the things that are going on up there will be a life cycle .
it starts with the grassroots , and then they come up with the <unk> , and eventually people are doing art , and they finally do art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentations .
so , i went home and ate with my wife , and then she said , &quot; well , second time , if you have this technology , you can use things to control things . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of an organization and a lot of things , from things , we have reached some things .
first , we &apos;ve got the doors to <unk> the doors , and actually got a device for blueprints to communicate with it -- one stephen <unk> .
it was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you &apos;re talking about him , or get a email , and you think , &quot; i am so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
in addition , we &apos;ve got seven programmer from around the world -- literally from all around the corner of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i have taken into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends think that we were going to be pretty stupid to do that , and we &apos;re <unk> and all the images on the walls would be <unk> <unk> .
but for about two weeks , we went into the <unk> in venice , my kids got involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we acquired on the <unk> <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the offices and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> processor , they put it on a file file , and we have a device that &apos;s freely accessible -- you can build it yourself , and you can download the code free , you can download the code free , you can download the code for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device which is fully free from limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
no hospital .
so , each paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back in <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room from someone else &apos;s bedroom , and that &apos;s his bedroom .
there &apos;s all this <unk> in front of the great unveiling in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks ago , <unk> and <unk> nights , depending on tony , he &apos;s drawing for the first time after seven years .
and this is an astonishing picture because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we &apos;ve tended to have a bed so he can see it outside .
we have a system projector against a wall of <unk> in front of the hospital .
and it <unk> for the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what kind of emotion was on in the common sense .
we also had to go back into the room , we didn &apos;t feel like a part of the <unk> .
at the end of the end , he was going to send us an email with the following : &quot; for the first time in seven years , i have something drawing .
i feel that , i was going to run under water , and finally someone went down and finally put it down , and my head rose so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
that &apos;s something like our <unk> .
so that holds us on the shelf and develop us progressively more and more .
and we have to make a lot of better on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s got a <unk> right now .
and someone who has a sort of <unk> potential , deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re at figuring out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve gotten all sorts of recognition .
we won a bunch awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one of us deserves about it .
it comes from our pockets .
so the other makers were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> over us and then , in december of december , has been honored as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really lovely .
and the ironic thing about it -- and this is a whole circle -- that it captures that april , in <unk> <unk> in downtown los angeles to give an exhibition in downtown los angeles called &quot; art of the <unk> . &quot;
and there may be that pretty much the toughest representatives of the <unk> expressway -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these boys will be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , if you see something that is impossible , it &apos;s impossible , then it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible at some point .
do you do it -- you &apos;re all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with <unk> , but i just did something deeper and surrounded with amazing people so we could put together something on the legs .
and this is a question to each of you , every single day , on every single day of something that you have something that you have to do , which is to get done done . if not me , who then ?
thank you .
so i &apos;m writing for children , and probably america is usually <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want a scientists like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmers , or , in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i &apos;d like to tell you about circles and <unk> .
now , one moment , one of the things you usually find is that you have to fall it somewhere down there .
you &apos;re about the block and you take it as a revelation .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i &apos;d like to tell you today .
my circle started at high school in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i got the bruises .
i was the one who was done every week in <unk> green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the <unk> .
they did it secretly .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had one thumb , and i had 85 dollars , and it took me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it to take a work on <unk> .
so , about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher , and i received a phone call , and i said , &quot; i must see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;d never seen each other as adults .
can you come to ohio from ohio , and please come into the man with the man i know you &apos;ve found him now .
and i should mention that i have <unk> , and i want you to come up with me . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we &apos;d laugh , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them down , and we took them around them , and we took eight of them , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn from the age of adult , me , turned it into a box of <unk> and put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , and it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i was talking about .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything to the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that it &apos;s so much mentioned today .
it takes the same -- it needs to be , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you very much .
imagine a big explosion while they &apos;re going to respond to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane in front of an airplane .
imagine a nuclear engine , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> power .
this sounds fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on <unk> .
i was the only one who could speak with the <unk> .
so , i saw them right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve obtained a few oiled birds . &quot;
the pilot had already <unk> the machine , and we were not as far as it .
you could see manhattan on manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot adjusted for the hudson river .
it &apos;s not usually the route .
it turns out the rockets turn off .
imagine a <unk> aircraft .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t need to talk more about the <unk> .
i couldn &apos;t see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was hut .
now i &apos;m going to share three things that i learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have these <unk> , we have these things we &apos;d like to make in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to reach a hand , and none of the fences i wanted to do , all the traits i wanted to do , and never performed .
while i was thinking about it later , i found myself a phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine grandchildren . &quot;
because when the wine is there , and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want more of something to do in life .
and that urgency , of course , changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and this was when we called the george washington bridge , so i thought about <unk> -- there i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really thought about .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my taste , i <unk> myself to become better in everything i care about .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego in ego .
and i &apos;m dragging at the time that i &apos;m wasting on <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , friends , to people .
and afterwards , as i was thinking about it , i decided to ban the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years old in my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right ; i got to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the internal watch <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; ma &apos;am in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to do in 20 parts , as you know it from <unk> .
while we were blind , i had that sense , man , to die , is not too scary .
almost as we prepare our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that kind of sadness really struggle with a thought , namely , that i only wanted one thing to do .
i just wish i could grow my children up .
so about a month of my daughter , i attended my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> .
... don &apos;t yet .
and i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything makes sense for me .
i realized at the time when i linked the dots to each other , it &apos;s only going to be a great father of being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , my only goal of life , is to be a good father .
i was getting the miracle of not dying on this day .
i received one more gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
so my urging of all these things today is : do you imagine the same thing on your flight -- not -- but imagine it ; and how would you change it ?
what would you do , which they would like <unk> , because they think they &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships , and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the key yield there for nuclear nuclear weapon is the cost of nuclear weapon in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here are <unk> .
now , if we can now improve the systems , which is what <unk> cups and valves control , then we can actually generate a lot of problems with it .
these gray boxes are not <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a totally different technology .
but if we manage to make an effective <unk> on a laptop filter , which is used by a rogue box to make this gray box , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we &apos;re starting with a <unk> approach .
the <unk> will skip in the grey box , missing in the centrifuge , and the iranian <unk> , and the iranian <unk> continues to be done .
that &apos;s a breeze , right ?
i want to tell you about how we found that .
when we started our research on six months ago , we were completely unknown to what the purpose and purpose of this dream was about .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most fundamental part , the <unk> part , made by thousands of thousands of oiled devices .
and it seemed a little bit of <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
so , the centerline of our attention and we started a glacial project in which we put our environment in <unk> , and we studied this construct .
and then something happened .
<unk> act like a cheese bottle who didn &apos;t like cheese -- <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and having experimented with different kinds of cheese , i decided to suggest that this is a <unk> attack .
completely targeted to one particular goal .
<unk> <unk> active <unk> on the gray box , when a special configuration has been detected , even when the special program , they tried to use it on the target .
and if nothing , then nothing does nothing .
so , i really got my interested in , and we started working with it almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might , say , for example , a <unk> american power station , or a startup company in germany .
so , we should pretty soon figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> and <unk> , we found the <unk> code , and we found that it &apos;s divided into two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional engineered , from people who had obviously available all the <unk> information .
they knew all those bits and <unk> they had to attack them .
probably they knew even the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you already have noticed that the <unk> is complex complex and precision , let me tell you , the prognosis of <unk> is a science of themselves .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see an excerpt from this <unk> device .
what we &apos;re talking about here -- about 15,000 lines coded code .
looks pretty much like ancient <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we &apos;re able to get smart from this code .
so what we were looking at first , were <unk> <unk> , because we know what they do .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and tried to connect with the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so , we needed theories about these goals that we could uncover or prove to them .
so , in order to make this case , call us in reminder that it is definitely about <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s got to act on a <unk> goal , and there &apos;s a lot of it in iran because there &apos;s most infections there were reported .
well , in this field , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
basically , it goes out on the <unk> nuclear power plant and <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; get me a list of all experts for <unk> and power plants from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them up , and i called them up to look at what we found in the code , what we found in the code and in the data .
and it worked very well .
so , it was able to create the little bit of little <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of times that there &apos;s a moving part inside the centrifuge , which is that black object you see .
and if you &apos;re using the speed of dna manipulation , then you &apos;re actually able to actually crack your gut material , and eventually you &apos;re able to explode your gut .
and what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the sediment is actually being able to happen slowly and more and more -- obviously , to try to make <unk> argument , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to go to that moment quickly .
the big digital <unk> -- we got a insight by looking at us very specific and <unk> .
so , for example , the number <unk> <unk> is very out of this code ; you cannot notice it .
i started out in academic literature , which is like these <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and found out that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> , and they discovered they &apos;re <unk> in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , fit together .
and it was even better .
these <unk> in iran is <unk> in 15 so-called layers .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the cafeterias ?
almost identical structure .
so , again , fit really well together .
and so , there gave us big faith to this , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of work .
and often , we just ran into a <unk> and to start <unk> .
anyway , what we found out is that both of the digital warheads is actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little splinters of wood takes over a video projector , and <unk> the rotors and slow it , and the big <unk> starts with six <unk> in interactions and manipulating it .
so , in large and whole , we very optimistic that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s only <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be obtained by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really <unk> out of the socks room .
down there is the gray gray box , and on top of it , you see the <unk> structure .
now what this thing does is that it cuts the incoming values from sensors -- so for example , from <unk> and <unk> -- and it turns out there &apos;s <unk> code , which is still during the <unk> with the <unk> data .
and actually , this is <unk> <unk> data from <unk> <unk> .
so , it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> is fed with previously <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not just introducing the <unk> in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more violent .
the idea is to trick a digital <unk> device .
we have to have digital <unk> where a human health cannot respond to where a human robotics cannot respond fast enough .
so for example , in a power station , when the large hadron collider gets too fast , you need to open <unk> inside milliseconds within milliseconds .
and of course , this cannot be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point , we need to have digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and not the <unk> , the <unk> , is going to find it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse worse .
and what i &apos;m now saying is very important .
think about that . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> interacting with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station , or in a corporate station .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the <unk> , you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , like we saw it in <unk> .
you can also use regular technology technology to spread out .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , you end up with a <unk> <unk> .
that is the consequence we have to ask ourselves .
and so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle of these attacks .
they &apos;re lying in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most important environments .
we have to make the consequences , and we &apos;re going to get ourselves better for us .
thank you .
i have a question .
it &apos;s been reported very much from it , that people think that it &apos;s a lot of people who is inducted the hood behind it .
is it also yours in your opinion ?
ok , you &apos;re really going to know that ?
yeah . ok .
in my opinion , <unk> is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
and so the driving force is the most important force .
there are only one and these are the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise our problem would be even more bigger .
thank you very much , you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years trying to place me in situations which are generally very difficult and kind of dangerous at the same time .
i went into prison -- difficult .
i worked working on a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i &apos;ve spent 30 days trying to spend nothing as this -- fun in the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i have seen the most part of my career in predicting <unk> situations , and it &apos;s all just trying to look at social situations that they &apos;re compelling , which are interesting and interesting , and hopefully on some way to understand what they &apos;re entertaining for the audience .
so , when i knew i &apos;d come here to look at a world in a tedtalk from <unk> and <unk> , i knew i would make something a little different .
some of you may have heard me from a couple of weeks ago in front of a few weeks ago on ebay .
i sent out some <unk> , some <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the possibility of <unk> at my tedtalk .
really , some of the people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that go -- the <unk> on the talk , which is not going to be a titles .
so what they got was presented here : my tedtalk , from which you have no idea of what is going to be going on , and you could end up with your ears , especially if i could align your company for your involvement .
but for that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
lots of lots .
by the way , this is just the <unk> .
so , despite this warning , i knew anyone who was going to buy the <unk> .
now if you had asked me a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project , i &apos;m working on , my new movie , we &apos;re exploring the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone through a couple of pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing was able to prepare me , nothing could i find on anything such as difficult and as dangerous as these guys were going to go into a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is look at disruptive <unk> , marketing , marketing , where the entire movie is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and marketing .
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , what happens in &quot; the forgotten <unk> <unk> , &quot; is everything up from the top till the beginning , from the beginning to the end , completely with tags , which are you going to see in the movie , which is the brand .
now this brand , the <unk> sports , the <unk> center .
these people will be connected with the film in terms of forever .
and so , the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- is what ? in infinite , forever ?
i &apos;m an ecstatic person .
that was more sensitive to say .
it was &quot; in malawi , always . &quot;
but we won &apos;t just have the brand x <unk> , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe , and it becomes the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever wore .
the greatest car that they &apos;ve ever seen is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the greatest drink they &apos;ve ever had , a focus on &quot; the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to point beyond , that tags , a part of life , is actually a part of the life , actually , to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of what it does .
the goal of the whole movie is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the entire thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the entire movie , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy when regulators were going to be able to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
have you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because it has a negatives -- but do you know how to evolve ?
how much money does it need to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make it , but i think it &apos;s worth it anyway , and i think it &apos;s definitely worth some common tags .
who knows if the movie came out , we might look like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing to deal with me ?
jk : both .
so , ... does not mean that .
so , my sir , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
ok .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people they have to do it with ...
there are some sites that we can look forward to .
take the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera . &quot;
it turns out it actually meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and they disappeared all these companies , one after each other .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
i was stunned .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface from new and old media and the <unk> media revolution -- it isn &apos;t the idea of being in this new exciting device to be the mass of this news .
no , that was what i thought .
but , you see , the problem was that my idea had an unfortunate mistake , and it was the following .
actually , that wasn &apos;t the mistakes at all .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would be ok .
but what &apos;s what this image is , is a problem .
you see , when you enter transparency in the <unk> plug -- this is one of the first pictures that comes out .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
and that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to explore and <unk> ; there &apos;s no doubt ; it &apos;s the last resort , and access to information , especially in the line -- the last line is the biggest thing .
you know , we &apos;re now listening to a whole bunch of transparency right now .
our politicians say , it says , our president says , even our business ceo , it says .
but when it comes to the extent that it &apos;s supposed to be done , there is something else .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this weird bear , the still <unk> bear .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like these strange <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what is still a risky case ?
a whole bowl of cool food contains food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell these story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
look when i was a kid , and my dad was lying on the lying -- and there he sits and look at me with this view -- he said , &quot; my son , there is three versions of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so , you see , with this movie , we wanted to talk about the real version .
but there was only one company that was willing to help us -- and it was only because i had known john bond and richard <unk> since years -- i realized that i needed to do it , and i needed to go to the <unk> and go straight with my team to the companies .
so what they started trying to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you begin to talk about these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be understood , an emotion problem .
i have friends that make big <unk> , and i have friends doing little <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends doing little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , gigantic energy companies make , say , why their movies are so successful they &apos;re as successful as they have .
and then my friends , the little <unk> , are saying , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , how accurate are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i go on the path , and whenever i open up the <unk> , they will see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i haul someone around , i can say , &quot; are you going to go blind enough to this interview ?
are you there ? you can see a little bit nervous .
i want to help them to calm down .
so , maybe they should kind of <unk> a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
you either say &quot; <unk> merger &quot; or a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re being taught both for men as well as women -- <unk> , or one stick , whatever .
this is the amino acid tryptophan .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give them a <unk> version .
we &apos;re smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;ve talked about as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , to make things -- you know , <unk> people from luxury -- that &apos;s kind of what we &apos;re interested in .
in which words would you describe them ?
ban is <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
<unk> technology : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone else does .
we &apos;re talking about clicks , d.c. .
i think , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is a great word to make these assignments for something , opposed to &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps them out .
we can keep them more fresh -- fresh fresh fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a bottom-up effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk with the guy on the streets , who are like me , <unk> .
they &apos;re supposed to tell me about my brand .
how would you put your brand brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like to really enjoy beauty clothing .
<unk> <unk> meets <unk> , except for the <unk> .
now , what is the brand <unk> ?
unique .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is arguably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of bridges and stuff like this .
but usually i have a pottery , like <unk> , or a jewelry , and such a jewelry .
if dan would brand a brand , it would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
voice # 2 : the brand i &apos;m , is going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; <unk> fly .
woman # 2 : it &apos;s mostly irrelevant , partially <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
man # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # .
i &apos;m selling <unk> throughout the country , worldwide .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my small , <unk> industry .
man four : my brand is fedex because i were <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is this ?
attorney : i am a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we cannot all be the <unk> , but i see myself often on the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what happened was , i needed a experts needed .
i needed someone who &apos;s going to percolate into my head , someone who could really help me understand what is called the &quot; dyer . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they &apos;ve helped to discover these <unk> .
if they were able to do it , they could help me .
they &apos;ve brought her photos , yeah ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who clarify my worldview .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so forth .
all of these things come from and start from a place , and you begin to start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what kind of context is that the thoughts and feelings about them themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what do you get us ?
what is the <unk> ? what <unk> are you ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represented the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about them , which is not them .
what else did they go through ?
so , don &apos;t you have to be scary . in what kind of rollercoaster do you have ?
a-ha ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for your batteries .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what comes from it .
there &apos;s lots of crazy stuff going on there .
the first thing i saw was the idea that their <unk> has two separate <unk> , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is a <unk> / brand brand brand .
add very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction of it .
and i think some businesses will only focus on a starches , instead of both of them .
many companies tend to avoid -- and this is the human nature -- things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re avoiding themselves , those elements , and they &apos;re actually creating them for themselves , and they turn them into something positive themselves .
what else else do they do ?
the first is a brand , apple .
and you can see it here , <unk> , there &apos;s inflammation , there &apos;s mini mini <unk> and <unk> .
now , there &apos;s <unk> tags , and there &apos;s tags tags , and tags tags , these things come and go , but a brand <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a brand soda brand , brand brand . what is your brand ?
if someone would ask you to describe your <unk> , your <unk> , what would you like ?
you &apos;re launching a <unk> ? are you something that brings blood into fungal sugars ?
or do they rather be a <unk> ?
are you something that a little bit harder , <unk> , conservative , conservative ?
<unk> are things that are playful , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , dropped out of <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , profane , <unk> , <unk> , profane , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a mini <unk> ?
are you mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditional , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate as oprah ?
are you reliable , consolidated , stable , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and fashion like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that are lined up and circled , and they said , &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything about that movie because they didn &apos;t have control , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it turns out 17 <unk> , who were willing to try to get rid of those control , which is what they wanted to do with someone to do what i think we could not have to have stories that we can &apos;t usually have -- stories that would ordinarily support us -- stories that would never aspire to have .
they were telling us to tell the story of the processor , like we told the story in this movie , which is used today to make the fundamental <unk> of the brain , both around for ads as well as films .
we went to sao paulo , where <unk> <unk> has been banned .
in the entire city , since five years , since five years , there isn &apos;t a poster , a poster , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went in school in school , and we went in high school in <unk> schools , across america .
and the incredible thing to me is that the projects i got from most feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i was interacting with things right now .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , and they said , perhaps , the agencies don &apos;t really have their interests in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
and i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will make people think that their assumptions .
and what was it for you ? what it was successful ?
now , because of the movie of the film <unk> film festival , we can look at it .
according to <unk> , the debut in january , and ever since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 650 million <unk> deployed from that movie .
this is actually just a <unk> span of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
and the movie wasn &apos;t going yet .
you don &apos;t even have online again . no secrecy .
he &apos;s still not yet to come out of other countries .
well , the movie has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every compass we &apos;re talking about trying to anesthetize her customer , who is the fingers of it .
one thing i realize is that if you take your chance , take your risk , take some risk in those risks .
i think if you prevent people from it , you get them close to failure .
i think if you &apos;re dealing with your employees , take risk , you &apos;re prepared for trying to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to start taking risks with taking risks .
we need to encourage people , not to have a fear of options that they might recognize .
eventually , in progress , we should be calling fear .
we should put the bear inside the cage .
you welcome your fear . you &apos;re welcome your risk .
one big spoon is filled with a big spoon , so we call the risk .
and eventually , we should be transparency .
today , more than ever before , bringing us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty , transparency , transparency , my homeland , &quot; called transparency , &quot; was told them from my good friends from <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
big data , for organizations around the world are turned into big opportunities .
<unk> <unk> , &quot; name transparency &apos; tales &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of the transparency -- what is happening now is that what is happening now is what happens now ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my wallet , on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in the neighborhood from $ 50,000 to the next year .
my name is <unk> .
so , 18 months ago , i was doing something else about google , and i started to do something with museums and art , and my <unk> , which is today , gave me a big light .
and it took me 18 months .
a lot of memorable negotiations and stories , and i can tell you , by 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s lots of stories about why we have done this .
i think my personal vision is very simple with this slide and explains your access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education -- i didn &apos;t smoke myself -- but i didn &apos;t have a lot of museums and that artwork had no access .
and then when i was traveling , and i started to see these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working on google , i tried to make this desire -- to make art more accessible -- with technology combined with technology .
we then kind of trained a team , a grand team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration of the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that had happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to go too .
you can look around these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m even in my favorite , the grand museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , is you &apos;re at the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you walk around and enjoy .
you want to get yourself in the museum ?
you open up the map , and jumping you with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go back to the end of the gang .
just keep . so much fun .
look around them .
thanks , but the best one comes out .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
when the museum has given us the picture , they click on it .
so this is one of the images .
these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click on here -- but i click that now .
this is one of the images we recorded with something called <unk> .
for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can see very easily in it and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this fellow ; his expression is <unk> .
but then they want to go deep down .
and so i started playing around with it , and i noticed there were something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; well , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to get near , and i noticed , slowly , these kids actually hit something .
so , i saw a little bit earlier with a number of met in the met , and actually finally found out that there &apos;s a game called <unk> <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> hacker with a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the perspective of what i think you &apos;ll see , so you &apos;ll see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one comes out -- one second .
so , let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you &apos;re going to see the <unk> ?
and what if you &apos;re trying to see how van gogh did this masterpiece of this masterpiece ?
you put aluminum inside . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in on one of my photographs of this image until i &apos;m really <unk> .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before that .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there &apos;s still many other yet , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part ; it &apos;s called collections .
every one of them , every -- if you have a pretty good car or poor , you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t play a role .
you can go and create your own museum online and create your own museum -- from all these images , they can create your own collection .
very simple , you go into -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> &apos; s , in the <unk> .
you can tag everything with notes , send your friends , and this entertainment begin about what you feel when you &apos;re looking at these masterpieces .
i think in closing , for me , is the major thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t really come from the museums to come from the museums .
i might not have to say that maybe .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i &apos;m hoping that we &apos;re going to live with this kind of stuff in art , and it &apos;s <unk> online .
it &apos;s the biggest question i asked to do recently , &quot; do you have this to replicate the experience of a performance ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s got to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a view of your brain . your brain can split into two half .
that &apos;s the one half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we were able to measure the <unk> at each risk , we could actually show your brain .
for example , it would be that somebody who is completely logical .
this would be someone who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brains on that scale ?
some of us might have selected for one of those extreme elements , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like something like this -- with a lot of <unk> , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not as though either they &apos;re either <unk> or so on .
they can be intuitive and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , along with most experimental experimental experimental <unk> , which takes a great piece of logic to make the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good core intuitions actually to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop those intuitions ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it , and then we &apos;re starting to develop our intuitions .
basically they &apos;re doing the same .
so one of the hunches that they &apos;ve developed with the years is that one thing can only be on a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be odd to think about it , that one thing in the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they have invented it .
i remember watching a child in play on a plate of play .
he was still a maverick and not very good at it , and he noticed all the time .
but i &apos;m sure that it teaches you to play a very precious lesson , which is a very important lesson , which is not just making you just last , and that you will remain at a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , as long as they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a horrible model for a <unk> , because they &apos;re not playing with <unk> games , but with those little odd particles .
and when they play with their particles , they see all kinds of things -- like they &apos;re walking right through walls , or they &apos;re going to go right through walls , they can be at the same time in two different sites .
and so they appealed to all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum quantum theory .
it was the chief of the physics of a few years ago , and you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but it didn &apos;t need to describe them around the big pieces of objects around us .
it didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and perhaps , because i don &apos;t usually play with particles like particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i haven &apos;t seen them yet .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particles .
but my logical page didn &apos;t like liked it .
because if all things are made out of particles , and all these particles followed the rules by quantum mechanics , then not just should they follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel even more strongly about the whole thing , if somehow somehow we could somehow show that <unk> is also following the rules from quantum theory .
so i decided a few years ago to do that exactly .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m launching here . we &apos;re looking at right here at the center .
and here &apos;s a really big big close-up of this small piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it is like a springboard shaped like a springboard and it sits over the edge .
so i made this thing on the same way that you make a computer chip .
i went into a windowless peace room with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours of all these big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to develop this as a solid pool of solid hole and getting this thing .
this is what has got the ability to look at the ability in the <unk> , but it takes a little bit of help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full lift ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of stuff , but then other people add up , and i &apos;m going to stop doing those things , because i don &apos;t want them to offend them , or , frankly , they &apos;re <unk> .
so quantum mechanics says that circular objects are comfortable with that same objects .
<unk> for <unk> objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to them on them and the wind at the end of the time , and the heat of the space .
and so , we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal , that piece of metal <unk> , we had to <unk> the whole <unk> out of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we took the light off , put it in a vacuum , put it in a vacuum , put it out of the air , and <unk> it up to almost <unk> , it was the piece of metal that was always going on .
so we measured his movement .
and we found that it was really moving really odd .
instead it &apos;s just lying there , <unk> it . the way it was <unk> was something like this -- like a billowing , and together <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave them a little push , we couldn &apos;t allow it to calculate the same time , and not true -- something only in quantum mechanics is allowed .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly awesome .
what does it mean for a object at the same time , and rather than grandiose ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms out of the order of metal is still lying there and at the same time moving the same atoms on and off .
just to accurate psychotic voices match them .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that each atom in the same time is two different places , which means the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth mentioning for all this year in the green room , because , you know , <unk> <unk> between one atom and that piece of metal is about as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t they be ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine that they would be too same in multiple places , like to feel that they might feel ?
how would your conscious mind is that your body in the room is <unk> ?
there &apos;s one more aspect about history .
when we put it out , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal there .
and so , i had to develop those new intuitions that look like all the objects in the elevator in a little bit just <unk> objects that are in a small room gathering together .
you &apos;ll hear a lot of talk about quantum mechanics , which is associated with everything linked to everything .
now , that &apos;s not really true .
there &apos;s more still more recently than it goes deeper .
it &apos;s so these connections , their ties with all those things around them , literally define who they are , and this is the <unk> and strange from quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum mechanics .
thank you very much .
in 2007 , in 2007 , i decided that we should talk about economics as we think about economic development .
it should be that when families think about it , if families think about it , where they want to go and work , you can choose between at least one hand of different cities that everyone in competition with new residents .
at the moment , we &apos;re very far from this target .
there &apos;s billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city on the developing world that they &apos;re welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth as much more than it costs .
so , we could really just bring the world very simple with <unk> , perhaps hundreds of new towns cities .
now this may seem absurd for you , if you haven &apos;t seen new towns about new towns .
so , they &apos;re just trading up on building blocks in cities .
imagine , half of the people who wants to live in homes , do this , but the other half is not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing laboratories .
but you know what they were going to get into those apartments and their neighbors have laws to avoid themselves , and from leadership to them .
so it turns out to be a very difficult thing to do all of these <unk> .
but you could go on a totally new site , and you could build an entirely new block , assumed that the law would provide such a structure , and it &apos;s not <unk> .
so what i &apos;ve proposed is that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city , and have given given them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> must have thought of reforming peace in corps .
they knew that every year they had about 75,000 <unk> abandoned their country in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and they can do exactly the same thing .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we put an <unk> patch of our country , <unk> in the mid- embassy , and if you want people to work with the canadian rules , or from the united states , they can &apos;t work there , and they can &apos;t go to the area of those messages to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , security corps suffered <unk> .
in the next elections , artist <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , whose program <unk> <unk> in a turnaround , and also <unk> .
he challenged <unk> to be his <unk> .
in the meantime , i prepared myself at tedglobal .
through improvement , trials and testing by consumers , i tried trying to use this complicated idea of urban city to reduce elements .
and the first point , is the importance of laws , laws , which determine that you cannot algorithmically existing performance .
we pay new technologies big , but for innovation , we need to demand it and laws , and it are usually laws that hold us back .
in the autumn of 2003 , a friend of guatemala sent out a friend of guatemala .
and again , it showed him <unk> .
these two call me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present it to the head of our country . &quot;
so , we met in december in december , in december <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure that valuable towns are about how much more valuable they are than they are spending a lot more valuable than they are .
and i used this graph to show up how valuable food is in a place like new york . think of it that one area in particular per square meter is worth thousands of dollars on dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form , which is that a nonprofit city is a place whose first city is a place , which is where the law decides who are there , and then people have the possibility to be either under those rules or not .
so , i was asked by the president of corps , who meant that we have to make this project , which is important , and that it &apos;s important to bring our country forward .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and i was asked to do a report on the fourth and fifth january , and i was asked to keep a lecture .
so i kept presenting with facts <unk> speaking , which has a graphic like this , which has tried to make sure that if you create a lot of effort in a city , it has to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the sketch is the new airport , which was built in <unk> .
by this airport , it has a property of 100 <unk> .
so , i tried to convince the <unk> of what you want to build a new city , you &apos;d have to start with a field from at least 1,000 points .
this is more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite are all <unk> .
the face of the audience was very serious and paying attention .
and the director of congress came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i went to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles from miles north in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in corps would depend on foreign aid , they could benefit from their chiefs , they could benefit from the charter to the charter , and then they would say that everybody &apos;s going to vote on that charter and actually enforce the charter .
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the <unk> of the <unk> that i was considering trying to make the foreign investors would be obtained for every parties in corps who had been suffering for many years of fear and mistrust since many years of mistrust and mistrust .
we &apos;re going to go into an area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s easily a thousand square kilometer .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , they selected for congress to have a change in the constitution of the constitution for special <unk> .
in a country that has a very violent crisis behind congress , in congress , for these <unk> <unk> with a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , supporting this .
but to be part of the constitution , but twice by congress , it has to be twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was approved to be a voice officer with a voice .
immediately after that choice , february and february , traveled from about 30 <unk> to the two worlds in the world who were most interested in the two places in the world .
this is a south south south .
this is a picture from a big , new core urban core , which is built in south south south south korea .
everything you can see on this picture , was built within four years , after it took four years to preserve the fruition .
the other place that is very interested in urbanism is singapore .
it was built already two towns in china , and the third one is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about this , this is where we are today .
they &apos;ve already got a <unk> solution ; and they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a law that has been working on a law that has been allowed , and it &apos;s been working on a law as well .
one country has already offered his supreme court court to provide as dish for the <unk> of the <unk> of the system .
also <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they get even funding with it .
one thing , as you know already , has been seen , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a place in america , and there are a lot of people who would like to live there .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who claim that they would like to live permanent in another place .
a million people abandoned a year and migrate into the united states .
many of them who are forced to shut down their families to <unk> their families , and sometimes single moms who need to earn enough money to sit with food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes kids are even children trying to find their parents , which , in some cases , hadn &apos;t seen more than a decade ago .
so what is it for an idea to think about <unk> a new new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or perhaps distributed around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between a number of cities in competition in terms of new inhabitants ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends , of course , have asked me to say , thank you , ted .
do you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you do in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey by over 2,000 americans , and the average number of <unk> , the average number is a typical american person in a day .
and then recently , a study of ceo has been made by watching the ceo of a week following the ceo of the week .
and these scientists just documented these different subjects , and they &apos;re documented , and how much of time they spent trying to make decisions about the issues that relate to the subjects .
and they &apos;ve found that a regular restaurant in the week dealing with <unk> tasks .
every one of those things was , of course , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of your decisions were done in nine minutes or less .
for about 12 percent of your decisions , they require an hour or more of your time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you put in the nine minutes of setting up for the one hour in one hour ?
how well , do you think they &apos;re dealing with the decisions ?
today , i &apos;m going to talk about one of the great jazz legends of our modern time , which is <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , i &apos;m going to ask about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to ask your answers .
if i ask them a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , only by hand , if they want to burn some calories .
because , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so , you &apos;re willing to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you very much .
when i was at stanford university at stanford university , i went to this very fancy store at the time ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store , called <unk> .
this business , it was almost as a <unk> .
they had 100 kinds of cool kinds of mustard and stored and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables , and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was at a time when we actually have been actually drunk drinking water .
i loved it to be loved , but at one point i asked myself , well , how do you do something ?
here &apos;s the olive .
they had about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including the ones that were embedded in boxes that came from a thousand years old <unk> .
so i decided to go to one day of branch , and i ask the director , &quot; does this model you guys really want to offer these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up at the <unk> of tourists that had every day , and usually they had their cameras .
we decided we had to do an experiment and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s your <unk> gait .
they had <unk> different kinds of womanhood .
we have a little <unk> right mounted immediately on the entrance of the <unk> dynasty .
we &apos;ve got six different kinds of figures out there , and we &apos;ve got six different kinds of mental illness , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;m going to go and try two things .
there are more people stayed when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it were six , about 40 percent as if it were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we saw in what case people bought more of a glass <unk> .
now , we saw the opposite effect .
by the people who stayed there , they were 24 percent , only three percent actually got a glass <unk> .
from the people who stayed there were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of them .
well , if you &apos;re doing it , people used six times more of a glass <unk> , who they had six at the same time when they were 24 at the selection .
now , i don &apos;t choose to buy glass <unk> , probably for us -- but it turns out it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that it &apos;s also affecting us very powerfully decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to choose , even though it &apos;s going to work on our own best interests .
so , for the day , resource markets are saving .
now , i &apos;m going to describe into a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we look at the decisions <unk> from almost one million americans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of <unk> , which was one of an <unk> , the <unk> plan , the chance it was going to determine whether it &apos;s going to be going to be going off tomorrow for tomorrow .
and what we found was that there was actually a context in action .
so in these labs , we had about <unk> plans that we created with something between two or a half million dollars in the world .
and what we found was that the more drug were offered , that , in fact , the participation rate .
now , if you look at the extreme core plans , the plans , the two fund in the &apos; 50s , had a <unk> <unk> in the &apos; &apos; 50s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans , almost 60 bucks , <unk> , <unk> <unk> now dropped out of the <unk> <unk> .
now , even though it turns out that even if you were to participate yourself , if more options on choice , even though more options were on the choice , it has unintended consequences .
so the people who were taking themselves , they tend to be more likely to have the more options they were facing , the more they were calling it , the more , they valued it , educating them .
the more options you have , the more likely they put their big money in pure <unk> .
none of those extreme decisions , directly to the decisions that someone else would suggest , when we think their future resource matters .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential unintended consequences that facilitate more and more and more choice with each more and more choices .
they made the decision -- push them up , even though it &apos;s going to be their own best interest .
they make more worse decisions -- worse financially and worse medical decisions .
they tend to choose things that they make themselves less satisfied , even if they make an objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy these huge shelves of these gigantic shelves , mustard , baking soda and <unk> , but we can &apos;t actually compare the settlements and limiting the <unk> , and then we can &apos;t actually take the settlements and we can actually make something out of the fantastic offer .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest now is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways -- those techniques that we can apply in different ways -- that they can &apos;t use it in their business .
first of all , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before before , but it has never been more than any more than today , that less is more than that .
people always disagree when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more , and more , if you &apos;re willing to go down , and the <unk> <unk> option , there is a rise of sales ; there will be cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a <unk> improvement .
as <unk> and <unk> , the different head and <unk> brands dropped from 26 to 15 percent , they experienced one percent of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden <unk> corporation sold down their 10 , <unk> <unk> , they experienced that profit by 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and the decline of costs .
you know , the average <unk> shows you about 45,000 of these products .
a typical video games today offers 100,000 products today .
but the most stable supermarket , which is <unk> supermarket today , and they &apos;re offering to just 1,400 goods -- a kind of yawn tomato sauce -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the best examples we have recently come to the market is about how to cover the choice , was something that david <unk> has been offered very powerfully , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
and every harvard harvard employees now tours automatically in a <unk> part .
those who really want to make a choice , give 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to fix it . &quot;
these are all important options . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m asking is , &quot; tell me how the options are different from each other .
and if your employees don &apos;t <unk> them , they cannot do their clients either . &quot;
now , before we have started now , i had a conversation with gary meetings .
and gary said that it would be willing to provide all the people in this audience who offer a <unk> vacation to offer the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a version of the road .
and i want to read you to them .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple seconds to read them , and then i &apos;m going to ask them if they &apos;re willing to assume gary &apos;s offering .
all right . everybody who is willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
are everyone everybody ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , what you &apos;re looking at , first of all , had more information than the second time , but i would like to guess it &apos;s going to guess it in the second time .
because the imagery had felt real for them .
what leads me to second technology that helps them to deal with the problem of self-reflection , it is the <unk> .
it &apos;s about understanding people in order to understand the difference between the possibilities , which is associated with the individual choices associated with the individual choices , and they need to be felt very strongly .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more than that they use a credit card or a credit card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out , if you make it a thing that it feels very specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
so , we &apos;ve done in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and we did one study with the people who worked on <unk> -- and these people were all <unk> in a convention that they took their participation project .
and during that convention , we were going to leave that convention as well as it was always , we added a little bit to it .
the small thing we have was asked by the fact that we asked people to think about all the things that would happen in their lives , if they were going to save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a decline in participation rates by 20 percent , and there was a decline in the number of people who were willing to save themselves , starting to pay four percent of the supplies that they were willing to pay for .
third technology : <unk> .
we can deal better with more than more choices than deal with more choice .
here &apos;s the study , for example , a study that we did in a study .
it turns out it turns out it &apos;s in the <unk> mountains above the top , and it turns down the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines and the bottom of the sky , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines up to <unk> magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines in 10 &apos; categories , or i &apos;m showing you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more selection and a better way to do it than i &apos;d give you 600 .
because the categories will tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one called jazz , and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the one on the left is <unk> , and the ad on the right jazz is , then they &apos;re clapping in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that on the left side of jazz is jazz and it , on the right side , is <unk> , then they &apos;re clapping .
ok , a few more .
well , it turns out they have right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a huge fibroid .
the categories must say something , which is not supposed to be the selection .
and so , you see this problem often , if you look at the long bullet points all of this fund .
who do they want to inform them ?
my fourth technique : sisyphus , complexity complexity .
it turns out that in fact , we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to just fix it .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision , the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car completely .
you have to make decisions different decisions to make your car entirely .
now , these decisions are different from the number of choice you put in per decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gear -- four possibilities .
now , what i &apos;m doing is , i change the sequencing in the order of choice .
half of the clients is going to go from the many ways , three <unk> , to the small options , four gear .
the other half of the clients goes from the small ways , four quick , four gear , to the 56 lanes , many options .
what do i look at ?
how cares they are .
now , if you continually use the <unk> characteristics of what they do , they &apos;re overwhelmed with <unk> , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find out is that the people who go from the many to the small <unk> are always going to pick up the <unk> choices .
we lose them .
deprive them of the little choice of the many , then they remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of ways .
the only thing i did is to change the order in which it is presented with this information .
so , when i start with the ordinary , i study myself like myself .
even though the gear , even though the gear , i don &apos;t choose about my own preferences in the interiors , it always teaches me to explore on it .
it also helps me with a big product of the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be engaged in action .
let me wrap it up .
and i told them about four techniques , which is the problem of the <unk> pioneer -- narrow them down the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- we can make them real ; we can deal with more things ; we can deal with complexity better , more options , depending on complexity .
so , every one of those techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunity -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , well to people that they provide service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you are selected by choice .
and the more we can pick them up , the better we will be able to make the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> of youtube . i look at <unk> myself .
that &apos;s true .
today , we &apos;re going to talk about how videos are becoming <unk> , and afterwards , which is why that is important .
we all want star -- celebrities , singer , comedians , comedians -- as i was young , seemed to be that infinitely hard .
but <unk> has speculated that we all , or all our creative work , <unk> famously , in part of the culture of our world .
every one of you may be famous for the internet to be next saturday .
but it &apos;s uploaded to youtube more than 48 hours a minute uploaded .
again , a tiny percentage will ever look at a tiny number of times , and will look at thousands of times , and as a cultural moment .
so how does this happen ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and unexpected .
well , then we want to go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
a-ha !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year <unk> <unk> <unk> this video he photographed in yosemite national park in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been seen 23 million times .
this graph is what it looks like when the video started last summer for the first time .
basically , <unk> didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because this is what you &apos;re doing when you called yosemite mountain bike coal .
he had uploaded every host of water .
and this video has actually been sent off in january .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there were jimmy <unk> <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> the tweet , which popularized the video of the game .
because <unk> , like jimmy <unk> demonstrates a new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> get down on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
rebecca <unk> <unk> &apos;s one of the most popular video of the year .
this year almost 200 million times .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like <unk> <unk> , it seems like nothing to come out of it .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , it was friday . it &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other tips are also <unk> .
but what about that day , that particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> nelson von <unk> , who was a first one who did twitter reporting on twitter about a joke .
what is important is that an individual or a group of <unk> takes a viewpoint to a big audience and thus accelerated the process .
then , this community of people who shared this big bang , and started to talk about it , and started to play with it .
now , there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of <unk> in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the gradual entertainment of the 20th century , the part of the 20th century is to become part of that phenomenon -- either by spreading it out or making something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; is it animation and music in <unk> .
it &apos;s very , very simple .
this year , almost 50 million times .
and if you think about it , you &apos;d like to know that there &apos;s been a knowledge of four million times four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
important creativity , creativity , which is in the <unk> movement of creativity and marshes .
there were back ruined .
somebody made an ancient version of it .
and then it became international .
all the <unk> fired from the ground that was done from a stupid joke to which we all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find joy of something , we do with it .
who would have predicted everything ?
who could have said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> slippers , &quot; could be explained ?
what <unk> did you have to write , which was something like <unk> ?
in a world where every minute two days will uploaded video to two days , only unique and unexpected <unk> like the ones i &apos;m going on .
i was not particularly interested in , as a friend said , i &apos;m not very much interested in seeing this great video , about a dude in new york against traffic ticket .
i got a traffic ticket , because i haven &apos;t gone down on the <unk> , but often there is no disabled who can &apos;t take a <unk> on the <unk> .
since it was totally surprising and it was humorous , got a lengthy <unk> revolution , and they &apos;ve been looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and everything leads us to a big question ...
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , where everybody has access and <unk> in the audience .
like i said , one of the most commonly challenging star -- justin <unk> -- did his beginning to youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas big light .
and today we feel all of us as the owners of our pop pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re not paying attention to the media from today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thanks very much .
how can i talk about the poetics of women talking about three generations , and like the astonishing power of this connectedness , of course , when she sat up with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother five days ago .
the story is not yet passed .
she &apos;s a puzzle that is still being composed .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first song : a man who &apos;s burning his manual &apos;s life .
and he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of its homeland .
consider him <unk> in front of the <unk> of the <unk> in front of him , as he got to acknowledge his life has been a single place .
the words , as long as his friends , <unk> his friends now .
he moved back into the silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never saw him personally .
but our lives are more much more than our memories .
my grandmother never raised his life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the history was not trying to get us out , but it was passed .
next <unk> demonstrates like a boat in <unk> <unk> <unk> on lake <unk> .
my mother may , 18 , when her father died -- he was in a marriage marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life took her a assignment : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely eliminated that they could fail .
after a four-year-old , and <unk> <unk> <unk> a boat on the sea , as a filler sell on the sea floor , as rwandan predators .
and all adults were aware of the risk of taking risks .
they had the largest fear of rape and rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little <unk> with her .
in a hurry , just my sister and me , and my grandmother , and my grandmother of her grandmother , and my grandmother of her grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the continuous <unk> of the motor , the clapping of every wave on the belly , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that many times , but went from the <unk> of men on our boat , <unk> <unk> , or for the <unk> of the motor , who didn &apos;t want to make six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> off of the caribbean coast , and on the young man who broke up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him and on the taste of the first <unk> that i had on the platform for one of the first men on the platform .
no apple ever saved again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we were covering in melbourne .
and the next generations is about four women in three generations that builds a new life together .
we settled down in <unk> , one from the middle , <unk> <unk> , whose population of <unk> is made of <unk> .
unlike the <unk> <unk> , their existence existence of existence , there were no <unk> .
the smell of the <unk> came from the world in the rest of the world .
and the balinese carpenters were broken between people who had one thing in common with one thing : they were spreading .
my mother was working on farms , and then on one layer in a row of <unk> , six days , twice , twice .
they somehow managed to find that english and <unk> laboratories .
we were arm .
and every one was assigned , and has been assigned to put in another education for english and mathematics , whatever we had to do for it , but mostly the new things that came from other hand .
two couple of co-developers for the school , each of them to cover the holes in the other .
it had to go down to the <unk> , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare but painful <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and here and there were <unk> , &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
go home where ?
something kind of calmed into me .
there was a meeting on reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i will take you out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were told each other from our day , and listening to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from <unk> from boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> , so i could <unk> them .
she opened a <unk> , and then she opened up a business store and opened up a business officer .
and women came in with their stories about men who <unk> the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> kids , <unk> between two worlds .
<unk> and sponsors were looking for .
centers were built .
i was living in <unk> .
in one of one , i was the classic indian student , who <unk> the <unk> on themselves .
in the other part , i was involved in insecure life , the bloodshed entanglement scars of violence , of the <unk> and the <unk> .
but a lot of effort got over the years .
and because of this help in my last year , as young <unk> of this year , as young <unk> of this year .
and i was sent from one <unk> to the nearest , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , has been tan tan le , refugee and social activist who became invited to enter places that they never heard before , and in housing , their existence never had never had imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything you could talk about .
i wanted to go back into the routine and the convenience of the life of a fish unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who told each of them as 20 years as they were telling each other stories of their day , and <unk> , we were still in the same bed .
i said my mother said , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she reminded me that i was as old as it was when we climb the boat when we climb the boat .
no one has never been a chance .
&quot; don &apos;t just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and be not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and education , and the neglect of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the more i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they were doing , they were living on the edges of the possible .
and even though i graduated from college , i realized i couldn &apos;t engage with a career in law .
there had to be something more intuitive .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s ok to be a maverick , a maverick , <unk> in the picture -- not just ok , but something to what you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can get so easily to collapse on the <unk> of the <unk> , so easily that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough out of my <unk> to know that , yes , the world isn &apos;t doing it , but not as you get it out of it .
ways that hadn &apos;t been allowed , reacted very strongly .
there was a power , a <unk> optimism , a odd <unk> of the humility and <unk> of the humility .
so i followed my gut gut gut .
i gathered a little team of people around me , for the <unk> , &quot; not challenging a challenge . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have a penny .
at the end of one , every day i cook a big bag of soup that we gave us .
we worked late until the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few lebanese , and we performed the breakthrough .
i made the decision to go into the united states .
there &apos;s only one journey there .
my gut experiences again .
three months later , i moved moved and continued .
before i go through the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> the social norm and the local speaker was the most important person in the country .
life hadn &apos;t been changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her first .
her mother moved her alone .
by 17 , she was the second wife of venezuela whose mother beat her .
she cared with her husband , she cared for a <unk> by putting him in front of him in her own , and then even more juice , when they performed .
&quot; don &apos;t be proved to be <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> in a hotel hotel hotel in a hotel room , when she died . 1,000 miles from in melbourne .
i looked at the <unk> and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sit with her coffin .
we told her stories , and we told them we were still among them .
and at midnight , midnight , and he said , he &apos;s got to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she used to keep her tomorrow , &quot; he said .
they didn &apos;t shut them out . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s about the women .
if you look at who we were forming and how life evolved us , we can now see that the men who would probably come in our lives , we were going to come into the <unk> .
the defeat would just be too simple .
now , i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i &apos;m still going to go on the boat .
who would ever wish ?
rb : yeah , i was afraid of privilege , prior to <unk> .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the motor , the infinite skyline that does nothing ?
i don &apos;t know it .
but if i could give this , and surely i could do it safely , i would do it .
there &apos;s also more persuasive mother today in the fourth grade , right now , on the fourth side of it .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even more elegant ?
because this is , of course , a painting you can &apos;t pick up with his camera .
yet , i started skating on photography when i received my first digital camera , age 15 years old .
i put it in with my previous predilection for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because it was actually using the camera in the process .
and if you take a picture of a camera with a camera , the process end when you shine on the trigger .
so , for me , it seemed to be more about being the right place to be at the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody , everyone could .
so i wanted to make something different , something where the process starts when it &apos;s going to be done .
photos like this : a site site along a lot of <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and it &apos;s still a realistic level .
or take photographs like these -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but everyone with the common goal of trying to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really get , but i &apos;m going to let it look like if you can &apos;t have it , in a photograph .
photos where you have to take a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea of capture an idea .
what is the actual thing that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details , or the color ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world and how it can be done on a two-dimensional area .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is rational .
so i think the essentials are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where they can take different pieces and put together in order to create an alternate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly <unk> physical objects that we can all relate to , in three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , you can combine something , you can create something that looks more closely than it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we trick our brains , because we don &apos;t just accept our brains , that it does not really make sense .
and i see the same process within pictures of photos .
it &apos;s really easy to combine different realities of realities .
so , the things that make a look look , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but when we combine to combine photographs , though , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you &apos;re looking at it kind of false .
so i would say there are three simple rules to obey a respectful outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but they can combine something like this , and they can make something special like this .
so the first rule is that mechanical photos should have the same perspective .
second , put together in the same way , put together recorded same photos .
and these two pictures of these two are made -- from the same height and the same <unk> .
and third , it &apos;s about impossible to make it apart from where the individual pictures begin to begin and end up creating them seamlessly .
don &apos;t make it impossible to tell what the photo was actually turned together .
by contrast color , contrast and contrast at the edge of the individual images , photographic <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders of <unk> , we &apos;re looking at the borders between these different images , and they &apos;re basically looking at the borders between the different images .
here &apos;s another example .
you like to think that it &apos;s just a landscape and the bottom line , and the bottom line is manipulated .
but this is actually completely composed of what this image is actually composed , from photos of different sites .
i think it &apos;s easy to make a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to choose a space , because you don &apos;t need to go into your ideas in your mind .
but it takes lots of planning .
and as i had this idea in the winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to plan the different places for the artifacts .
for example , the fish had been taken on a <unk> ball .
the shore comes from a different place .
the <unk> comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island in red <unk> to make it look for swedish .
so , to make a very reactive outcome , it &apos;s going to happen from me to plan .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of these different images .
and this is every bit very well planned .
and then if you make good images , you can be quite beautiful , and also quite acceptable .
so , there are all the tools there , and the only thing that is limited to us is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about that , why so many electronic <unk> fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced at the ted administration has been going to be a <unk> .
and it &apos;s not very scientific yet -- it turns out there &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and they ask the patients , families , cousins , &apos; families , &apos; families , &apos; families , &apos; families , &apos; families , &apos; how do it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the subject of the effort , is because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on / / .
and every morning i get on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i did my job in 95 pounds .
it &apos;s very simple : every time i get on the scale , they send my data on google health .
and then they &apos;re going down from my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my horoscope is , not only in the moment i &apos;m going to help financially support or something , but also with a glimpse of the past .
there &apos;s something else .
perhaps , you know , i &apos;ve known about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so , every morning i jump on my <unk> , and people talk about me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; lunch , just a little salad lettuce today . &quot;
but this is the <unk> thing , because this is what &apos;s going to happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because it could be used on obesity , or it could be used for obesity , or it could give patients that smoke .
but it could also be used to get people out of your chairs and get them to play some kind of play in order to control your health .
and it comes down , and it comes down to the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> that you put on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure home from home your blood pressure , to send it to your doctor , for example , to share with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patient comes into game . they cannot just take control of their own ship , captain on their own ship , but also help us with health care in the face of the health , twin demand , and so on .
do they make using methods that are easy to use , and start to embrace patients in the team .
and they can reach through those sorts of methods , but also through <unk> .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i &apos;d like to share with you a short video .
we &apos;ve got all sorts of cars in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all of these atms are <unk> around <unk> .
we know another one where all stations gas stations are .
and sure enough , we can find <unk> .
but where is the next frontier to help to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and no one knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving <unk> <unk> at that moment was .
so what did we do ? we did <unk> in the usa .
we set up a website and a <unk> asked , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share you with where he is , &quot; because sometimes it is closed in <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> have been reported in the usa .
the next step was to try to find the apps on it .
and we created a <unk> machine .
we &apos;ve developed an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and you &apos;re going down , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can substitute up to the next trash , which can rescue life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to be as <unk> as the product is called , but it &apos;s also known as <unk> .
and we want to bring this to a world level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like atms in the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and you &apos;re on vacation , if you &apos;re on your own <unk> or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies around the world are helping us with the <unk> of these <unk> .
these might be <unk> , or for example , to make sure that there is only to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still still in its place .
so please help us , and try to improve health , not just trying to improve health , just to take on your hand .
thank you very much .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i &apos;m collaborating in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> is that we force forcing us to make environment .
... it gives you the <unk> heed .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might be , until it is <unk> .
now , we can skip that just -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video -- i &apos;m going to skip the video .
no .
this is not ...
ok .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is passed by ?
ok . thanks very much .
so a bunch of years ago , i launched a program to get the star in technology and try to take a sabbatical and work in an environment that is so quite everything they don &apos;t actually hate , we have to work them in government .
this program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> <unk> .
we selected a number of fellows every year and we &apos;ll work them with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re going to send them in <unk> .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they do really is to show what is possible with technology today .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city boston .
and here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date on a date , but what he really looks like is someone who is <unk> him , when he is <unk> , he &apos;s not really good at the <unk> when he comes from a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for this particular way ?
we had a team last year in boston in boston called the &quot; code for america &quot; program .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of february of a lot of time .
and they realized that the city was never <unk> out of this fire hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik <unk> , noticed another thing , and that was that the inhabitants of the sidewalks were free <unk> , right in front of these parts .
so , he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a kind of nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you &apos;re <unk> to <unk> him , when it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you can &apos;t do that , you can take it from someone else .
so there &apos;s a nice little dynamic game dynamic .
this is a small little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21st apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t other people do .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> department of the city <unk> , who seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens <unk> themselves .
it &apos;s really important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so , he got the citizens to test them .
and then seattle , and then seattle , the app to use the company to clean the citizens <unk> <unk> .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people that <unk> people , when it &apos;s <unk> .
we know now nine cities , and we &apos;re planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s very widespread organic , of course , organic , of course .
if you know something about sisyphus , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually happen .
the software takes off of software takes a few years .
we had a team working last year on a project in boston , for three people two and a half months .
it went to find a way to work with the parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
we told later that if it had taken over the regular canals , it took over two years , and it could cost about two million dollars , and it killed over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there is currently a project in the central right now , which is cost cost about two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so , an app that is written in a few days , and then from <unk> spreading , is kind of shot on the front of the page on the government &apos;s institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer how a private sector , how many people think they should .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet themselves .
and it means free access , which is open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but importantly , what &apos;s important about this app is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a curable institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good novelty , because it turns out we &apos;re very well doing collective action with digital technology .
now there is a big community of people who are creating the tools we need to do things effectively effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all across the country who are getting up and <unk> , every day in their communities .
they haven &apos;t stopped the government .
they &apos;re feeling dreadful with her , but they don &apos;t complain about them , they fix them .
and these people know what we lost from the eyes .
and that is , when you all know about politics and the snake in the <unk> and all the other things that we really forget about , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , saying , &quot; what we do together we cannot do . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of people out there today .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to talk about it , because things change things .
politics is not changing ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally ends up losing their power from us -- encouraging you to people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought , well , the government is basically about to choose people in a foreign office .
now after two years , i finally went to the conclusion that it comes from community communities to <unk> <unk> .
this is the job building for service and information .
you usually get out when you &apos;re in your city <unk> <unk> .
now , if you &apos;ve ever got the chance working in your <unk> business center , like our fellow teammates , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing that -- you &apos;re going to see people doing a lot of different problems , including , including , in your house .
so scott gets this <unk> device .
they &apos;re typing &quot; <unk> &quot; in the official database .
and he does not really have an idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and finally he says , &quot; look , you can &apos;t open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if it &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . scott .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston didn &apos;t only have a job .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we haven &apos;t written this app .
this is a work very smart people at the office of the new urban <unk> hotel in boston .
one of the things -- this is an actual report -- came in with this : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . &quot; can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get away from it ? &quot;
but what happens in <unk> is going to be different .
scott <unk> himself from human being to human beings .
but in <unk> <unk> , everything is public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next chapter that we got was , &quot; i went across there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yeah . alive ? <unk> .
and finally , <unk> on the side . went home .
good night , honey <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . here &apos;s the digital version of the digital .
and it &apos;s also a great example of how to get the government into this .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of leadership .
i tend to talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
citizens helped the other citizen citizens , but the government was acting a central role .
they joined these two people .
and you could link them with national standards if they could link them , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to public services service .
if one neighbor &apos;s neighbor , we &apos;re going to enforce our communities .
call the <unk> , costs it costs a ton of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think about it , is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand this , but they think that one is the input from the other .
that our contributions to the system is choosing .
we selected a political leaders -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we go back and we expect that the government , our values and our needs , doesn &apos;t change a lot ?
that is , because the government is a continued ocean , and politics are the top .
and what &apos;s below below is what we call a bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such disdain .
but it &apos;s the kind of speakers that we have , which we have , and we &apos;re paying for something that is working against us , something that is working on us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem like to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we have to make a bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual blast is occurring .
we &apos;ve got to focus on the engines of the government .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is a response to the media lab on the <unk> .
this is not political being active , is active active .
now , for those of us who left the government , it &apos;s time for us to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce you to the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really think we &apos;re achieving achieving what we need to do without trying to improve the institution in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely vital , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology can make it possible , because the function of the government is inherently <unk> in a way that can actually make a difference by society .
and there &apos;s one generation growing <unk> internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build things together .
now the age of our teammates is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with her voice for granted .
they don &apos;t struggle for that struggle to talk about who is to talk about who , you know , who is allowed to talk to them .
you can express your mind , on any channel at every channel , and you &apos;re doing it .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your vote .
they use your hands .
they use your hands to write applications that improves the work of government .
and these apps for us use our hands to optimize our communities .
that might be a fire hydrant , <unk> gaga gaga <unk> , a trash trash with a trash compactor .
and sure enough , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government , taxes are taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i for all of you here is , if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
it &apos;s usually my role in explaining how wonderful these new technologies that are going on . and i thought , because i &apos;m lying there among friends here , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think about .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a little bit about a single bit of boring slide .
... wouldn &apos;t you point the slide .
this is a slide i selected from my penis folder .
so it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather it &apos;s about the overall shape .
this slide shows from a analysis of view about the power of recording processor compared to the performance of a <unk> network of networks .
and what &apos;s interesting here is that this slide , like some of the other things that we often find out of our field , is a kind of starbucks on a downhill curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a potency in the <unk> .
and this is what we need to use this guy on <unk> curves in the field of technology .
something &apos;s very weird here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights again again .
another bit more because i &apos;m going to draw on the same piece of paper here .
now why do we draw from <unk> on technology on <unk> curves ?
and the reason for that , if i would draw it on a regular curve , where , you know , the timeline is the timeline , which is a kind of incubation of the technology that i &apos;m going to be looking at with a graph , then the graph is ridiculous .
and then they look like this .
and that won &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a silk processor , and then it would come on in the <unk> scale , in shape of a flat line .
but if something &apos;s going on here , this is what the <unk> changes changes .
so , as fast as the pharmaceuticals would go as fast as the <unk> , we could get into a cab , and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not really fast .
and that had never been seen before in the history of <unk> growth , this kind of <unk> growth , which is increasing for the order of every few years .
now , the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you see , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s always evolved forever , so fast as fast as it develops .
there are two options .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic <unk> like here , like this , to come up with something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
so , really , this is what it means , and we &apos;re here at the moment in the moment in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also want to ask myself , is what this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that the world is starting off ?
because the transition does seem to be very , very eagerly when you &apos;re in there .
when i was still a kid , there was a year somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in the year 2000 .
beyond that we don &apos;t go .
so in other words , the future is every year for a year since i &apos;m in this world .
and i think the reason is that something is happening is something that is happening .
it &apos;s happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that there is simply no meaning to try and look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything will be so different from what we currently do .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition that we &apos;re at right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which is really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really really understand this , we need to go back step back and look at this thing in a <unk> environment .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on earth life for the earth .
i think this big makes sense when you divide it up into some <unk> .
so , let &apos;s go back , and this is about two billion years , and the earth was a big bang , <unk> <unk> with many of these chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals organized , we have a pretty good picture about how these chemicals were organized , and then we have a pretty good picture about how they were doing it .
so , i think there &apos;s theories that are starting to begin to understand how everything i started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little simplified story about it , which is why different kinds of bacteria contain chemicals in those kinds of chemicals .
some of these tumors contain a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside of the outside .
they were all about it , started to tile .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but these objections were not about alive , in today &apos;s sense , because each one of them was just a little , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it &apos;s shared , it &apos;s distributed to split chemicals into clusters of chemicals .
so , each <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> chromosome , which one for the growth added chemistry had faster than others and integrated more chemicals and more chemicals from outside , shared chemicals from outside and shared .
so , these tend to survive more than surviving longer , and they tend to survive in more ways .
so this is just a very simple chemical chemical form of life , but it &apos;s more interesting when these deletions became a trick of abstraction .
in addition to anything that we don &apos;t fully fully understand , these organisms have the ability to endure information .
they &apos;ve learned the recipe &apos;s recipe from the cell as information , and it &apos;s in a chemical chemical shape that we call dna .
in other words , they &apos;ve found that in these <unk> , evolutionary way , they &apos;ve devised a way that allowed them , <unk> what they &apos;ve been stored , so that this information was stored and it could be obtained .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information has accumulated over the time of 2.5 billion years ago that they were born in the same way .
in fact , recipe recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same coded , and the same spelling .
and it uses every type of things that is used exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re at the same time that we can write , only to write things in this code .
and i &apos;m here 100 <unk> from a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to keep in <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is , what i &apos;ve done is i took this coded -- the code is made from regular letters , which we use for <unk> , and i put my snorkel on a piece of dna , and i put it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my specialty , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had been in a conversational system , i would have written them on a virus and open in the room .
so what &apos;s next step ?
the dna scan of dna was an interesting step .
and the standard of these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting , very interesting step where things were completely different , and then they started to communicate these cells and information , so that communities emerged from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually encourage their dna .
so , this is why for example , the reason is increasing with antibiotics .
some bacteria figured out what they can stay from penicillin , and they &apos;ve written this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
these communication allowed now to create communities , which in particular , were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
and so they either survive together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community were successful , all the individuals of the community were capable of repeated all the citizens in the community more often and from the evolution .
and the <unk> is now where these communities so close , they decided they decided to write recipe recipe for the entire community to write the recipe for the dna .
and the next interesting thing took about another billion years went about another billion years .
at that time , we have ignorant communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together as a single organism acting as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a polluting community .
we &apos;ve got a lot of cells that have no longer been focused on themselves alone .
your skin skin is useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started forming , so that the level on which evolution was occurring , was no longer the single cell , but the whole thing we call the growth of what we call the organism , what we call the organism , which we call the organism .
step next step within those communities .
the <unk> started to abstract information again .
and they designed very specific structures which did nothing different than processing information inside of the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
and so the neurons are the <unk> who built these panels .
they were going to depend on specialists in the community in the community , specifically structure , which are responsible for learning , understanding and reporting information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
there gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this time , an individual -- learning occurred in the span of the span of the life cycle of one organism , instead of all this evolutionary span .
so , for example , as a organism , for example , a particular fruit couldn &apos;t eat a particular fruit , because she wanted to eat him sick , the last time he was eaten her .
so this could happen in the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because that information needed to be learned from the individuals who were dying , because of those ancient people still hadn &apos;t been there .
so the nervous system has the <unk> system of this particular nervous system because evolution could now work within an individual .
it could happen within a time period of time .
what happens later is that the individual organisms would find a way to communicate with each other .
so , for example , the <unk> dissection culture is known as the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my mind .
i &apos;m sitting in there , and i &apos;m basically taking notes from myself , hoping to make a similar <unk> idea in your mind , which is a kind of similarity with my original idea .
so , we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and producing something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to think back as a conscious creature .
and what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve actually done , we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re allowed to go through the same stages , which have gone through the process -- the abstraction of our recovery , how we capture data , how we metabolize data , we process process .
so for example , the invention of speech , for example , was a little step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , and so on , are all our mental mechanisms that we built in our community in our community to extract these information .
and it allows us all together with something that is much more accurate , and also able to continue faster than we &apos;ve been there .
so now evolution can happen in the span of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen <unk> little <unk> , where he has a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right in front of your eyes .
so , now we have the <unk> device again .
the first steps of the story i told you about , ooh , one billion years every one .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , <unk> a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like speech and so on , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next stages , like electronics , usually seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself and becomes more , i think , <unk> is the word -- if something its <unk> gets more intense .
the more it changes , the worse it changes .
and i think this is what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that lives off itself .
i &apos;m living professionally from building computers , and i know i can &apos;t use the mechanism i &apos;m using computers to build computers , without the recent advanced technology in computing .
my latest work is to design objects with such a high complexity of complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design those in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any of every transistor in the <unk> is doing .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking about <unk> is , we &apos;re thinking on a certain machine , putting it on the machine , and the machine does something beyond our ability to make up better and faster and faster than we could ever do it yourself .
and it &apos;s kind of doing it with kind of stuff that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and which i &apos;ve used lately is the evolution itself .
so we install a laser beam machine in the machine , which is what it &apos;s done in the chain .
for example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random fuels .
we &apos;re saying , &quot; computers , <unk> , 100 million randomly selected sequences of agents .
now , please , all of these selected <unk> hooves , all sorts of programs , and eventually choose those , which are the least of my policies on the other . &quot;
so in other words , i think first what i want to do .
let me tell you , i want to split numbers , which is a simple example that i used for that .
so , find programs which can rank from most accidental numbers .
and of course , the chance at random <unk> is very small because it just happens to number numbers , which is a number , which arguably , arguably , don &apos;t actually follow the direction .
but one of those things in the right order of luck is two numbers in the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of those sequences , which are the ones that came out of my checklist .
they shut it down , <unk> the rest of the rest .
now , all of the sudden all the people who have sorted out the numbers on the best .
in fact , with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
pick two programs and they &apos;re producing children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children <unk> the edges of the <unk> of those two programs .
now , i have a new generation of programs that used to emerge from combinations of programs that came along with those kinds of programs as others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> them again .
let might give some mutations .
and trying to do this again with another generation .
these generations need just take a few milliseconds reduction in those generations .
and so , i can &apos;t have evolution over millions of years in the computer in the computer in less minutes , or in some cases , a few hours .
eventually , i get programs in the end , by the end of the numbers perfectly borders .
in fact , these programs are as much more efficient than any program i could ever have by hand .
and then when i look at these programs , then i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
there are <unk> and odd programs .
but she did do the job .
i know , i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to go through the job , because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because her life depended depended on her her job .
i sat down in a 747 with marvin <unk> , and he <unk> a map of <unk> , and he says , &quot; look , look at it . look at it .
there &apos;s this airplane in <unk> <unk> , which are working together trying to make their flight safe . &apos; does not make it <unk> ? &quot;
we know that a penis is not perfect if it becomes too complicated .
so we begin to rely on computers , for a process , which is different from the classical engineering structure .
it allows us things with a lot higher complexity than it could allow us to produce normal ways .
and yet , we don &apos;t yet understand the possibilities yet .
so <unk> <unk> technology is the technology .
so , we use these programs to make the computer a lot faster , so that we can begin to do these processes even faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> structure .
it gets faster and faster , and i think it &apos;s why it seems so wrong .
because all these new technologies are needed from themselves today .
we shut down .
we &apos;re at a point where analog is at the back time , as being evolved into <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t really fix it , which is actually a hell of the hell we &apos;re actually attached here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> zone .
but i really believe that after something else comes from us .
i think it &apos;s very poetic of us to say that we &apos;re the evolution of evolution .
and i think everyone here is part of the creation of what &apos;s going to happen as well .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to stop there before i &apos;m going to go ahead .
my story starts in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was sitting under the starry sky in the sky with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the time of the ancient indian <unk> . &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back to indians at the time , we flew into a car and <unk> across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing congestion airplanes .
back then when the big indian <unk> <unk> thirst , he took an arch , fired in the ground and stepped out into the floor and stepped out of the water .
now we &apos;re doing it with <unk> and machines .
and we came from the conclusion that magic and magic have been replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a bit fearful of technology .
it was scared i could lose the ability to have the ability to enjoy the sunset with the sunset and no tweet in my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
she became an ecstatic access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and images in my mind .
i thought it was as if we were feeding our fancy clocks and dream of ownership of it .
they were inspiring us to be inspired by this .
and so in the world , i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it rather than expected .
by 16 i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it puts pictures and text together , and animation , imitation and touch .
it always needed more senses .
but what do we do about it ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , interactive ipad , an interactive ipad .
here says , &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- this is &quot; this box &quot; -- &quot; i write my name . &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to figure out a figure in the book .
and again , a letter comes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- it &apos;s really true to me .
so , the kid in my mind is really enthusiastic about this .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean rod and dragon , but i mean the magic of childhood , the ideas that we &apos;ve all had as children had .
fireflies in a glass of glass , i always discovered very exciting .
this is how you put the ipad out there and the fireflies &apos;s fireflies .
and it &apos;s illuminating the way through the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that there can be a whole galaxy in a single <unk> galaxy .
and what &apos;s going on here every book , and every world will have a little bit here , which i &apos;m here here is the magic device on the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> always used maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and shining for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also teaches them to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going into this .
also , it &apos;s important for me to create something that is important , but it is also very empowering .
these are the dispensers .
we have all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
and the poor <unk> were stuck in <unk> chambers in <unk> , in an old <unk> book .
and we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary history of children for children .
one of the things that goes on with new issues , like the <unk> .
for the last 10 years , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their computers , with no <unk> .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
on an interaction of book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and start with the camera from the ipads images of natural objects .
as a kid , i had a collections of sand , stones , <unk> and clams .
somehow , children don &apos;t make anymore .
this is <unk> . you have to go out and run out in one chapter a photograph from a flower and tag it .
in another chapter , you have to highlight a piece of memorable <unk> and tag .
so , you can actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then ask online .
a kid in london is showing the picture of a <unk> and saying , &quot; oh , i saw a fox today . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i saw a monkeys . &quot;
so that creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photographs that you actually sampled .
there &apos;s a number of millions of ways to combine the world and technology with each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re using an interaction where you used to use the video of the ipads and actually looking at a animation from <unk> reality that looks at a plant in front of your home .
at one point , the screen is filling up with petals .
you &apos;ve got to make the sound of the <unk> , blow them away and reading the rest of the book .
we &apos;re all moving towards a world where the natural forces of the technology can come closer and into the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer closer to us to the natural world , and the magic and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you very much .
this is truly a true honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there is a lot of hopelessness .
being in here at ted , to see how stimulating this is , has given me a lot of power .
in the short run here , i became an obvious : ted has an identity .
you can say things about the world that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , when something about ted comes out , it &apos;s a significance and a force that doesn &apos;t have it .
i say , because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we have learned that the words of the teacher matters , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful in them .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a physician , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
by the way , i did not learn from my work as a advocate .
i learned from my grandmother from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional household household household , dominated by a <unk> household , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had the effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the starting point of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a forger .
their parents suffered in the <unk> in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped like a lot .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up with me and <unk> me .
it hit me so that i could barely breathe , and then let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , feel like you feel my <unk> ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; when i said , &quot; if i said , &quot; yes , let me <unk> it .
it was something that was done , that you always wanted to be anywhere near you .
the only thing about it was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i got eight or nine , i &apos;d woke up one morning and went into the room , all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the cliff and staring at me .
first , i thought that would be a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
so 15 minutes or 20 minutes , and she came up with me , and she came up with me and she said , &quot; come on , <unk> , <unk> . you and i , you must talk . &quot;
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me out and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to tell you that you don &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , ma &apos;am . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
she said , &quot; you have to just promises three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , tell me that you will always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom is my baby and you have to do with promises that you will take care of her . &quot;
i loved my mother , and i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next time you &apos;re going to do the right thing to do , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i was thinking , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
eventually she said , &quot; the last thing you have to do is , &quot; you &apos;re never going to suck alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older than a year old sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day later , my brother came home and brought this wild beer with me and joined with us in the forest .
we just haul around there as they do it .
then he took a yuck beer and a poster company of mine , and she took me , and then she gave me one of them .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . &quot; do you all . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing whatever we do .
i had to guess what , your sister had , you know , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . &quot; do you only . &quot;
my brother staring at me .
and he said , &quot; what is going on with you ? now , <unk> , what do you do ? &quot;
then he looked at my face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do it yourself , because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tell every grandchildren they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was breaking down on the ground .
i &apos;m going to talk to you something .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this is perhaps applicable in public domain .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i swore i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying it because i think it &apos;s warranted . i say , because identity is power .
if we build the right kinds of identity , we can &apos;t tell people around us things they first don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all of her grandchildren said something special .
my grandfather was during the prison hospital in prison .
my uncle died from <unk> diseases .
and she believed that these things were the subjects that we needed to deal with .
i tried to say something about our bodies .
that country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1954 , 300,000 people in <unk> and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest <unk> in the world today .
seven million people are waiting on in <unk> or with <unk> <unk> .
in my opinion , <unk> has altered fundamentally changed our world .
in social and black , and black parts of the population are affirming despair and helplessness , because of those changes .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities anywhere in the country -- from los angeles , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black young men are either in prison , in prison , in <unk> <unk> .
and our system is not only shaped by the way that we have to do with self-reflection , it &apos;s also being ruined by poverty .
we have a belief in this country , which is much better when they &apos;re rich , when they are vulnerable , and they &apos;re innocent as poor as poor and innocent .
wealth , not <unk> , influenced the result .
yet we seem to be satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i find that interesting .
there &apos;s some sobering designs there .
my home state , alabama , <unk> <unk> , when they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male population permanently lost their <unk> .
we found that in 10 years , the <unk> of the <unk> of the civic <unk> is going to be so high in front of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states from america is the only country in the world that <unk> children in prison for death in prison .
in this country in this country , there are children <unk> <unk> with no <unk> whatsoever .
we have a lot of process .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
and we believe , because what we &apos;ve taught is that the true question is : does a man deserves a man to die of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we view our identity .
the other perspective is not : have someone made death for a crimes of death , but , did we have to kill it ?
i find that fascinating .
death penalty in america defined by errors .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed , who we &apos;ve been executed for an innocent vehicle , the <unk> and the death house off of death .
an astonishing <unk> . one of the nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never fly someone with an airplane if for nine planes , which are going on , one crash .
but somehow we manage to get ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden . it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right thing to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i think my students african-american history , i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time at the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the two second war world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the folks in this country , it was a time of the terror .
in many places , people had faced fearful of anxiety .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life shaped .
now these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr , <unk> , you &apos;re talking , they freeze talks . they say they &apos;re going to stop there for the first time in history of our nation with terrorism , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell the people that we grew up with . &quot;
and of course , after terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> motivated unarmed activities and apartheid .
and yet in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done in history in the historical context .
we populated all the time through each other .
we always create new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get ourselves into the process of the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the <unk> is unable to overcome the <unk> and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were no willingness but not in this country .
i did some of the talks in germany over the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply bizarre to hear them talk . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death .
and of course , they can never give more of them in germany . &quot;
it became silence . and then one woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to kill us again for the phenomenon of people .
it would be <unk> of us , consciously , and target human beings . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like it , in a world where the german state of people <unk> <unk> , especially if they were sleeping with a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we &apos;re setting people up -- there &apos;s a chance to be sentencing , as the victim is white , as if it is black . 22 times higher , when the dissolved black is black and the victim knows -- in the same states , the bodies of <unk> .
and yet there is this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with those difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also concerned about it too .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually these realities are <unk> from suffering , abuse , <unk> , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately discuss more hope that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to allow in a complex world .
for me , it does take time to start thinking and talk about the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , who will never be at ted .
but think in a way that &apos;s embedded in our own lives .
we all have to think of all the things we can &apos;t see .
we do it . so we &apos;re rational as much as we appreciate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that will be driven by the beliefs in our heart .
it &apos;s these <unk> , which i think they &apos;re driving us , not just to be seen for all the light and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politician , once said , once said .
&quot; when we went in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but ultimately , what we needed most is there was hope , one spiritual guidance , the willingness , sometimes in <unk> places , to be seen and witness . &quot;
so , this mental orientation is the essence of what i think we need to inspire people to get engaged in action .
there &apos;s no shortage of technology and design that allowed us to be fully human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , apartheid and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity takes a lot more from us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
as a young middle-class nigerian middle-class , i delivered the big privilege to make pink parks .
so , there was always back again after <unk> , where she hid two of her ancient friends , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , her husband , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women met themselves , and they just talked about them .
and then finally , ms. <unk> called me and said , &quot; <unk> , black parks come into the city . we want to talk to us .
do you want <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i loved . &quot;
she said , &quot; what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just listened only .
it was always so inspiring , so voluminous .
and one day , i sat there listening to these women , and after a few hours , a lengthy <unk> woman said to me , &quot; well , <unk> , tell me about what the physics is like for the same time .
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to conserve the mines and <unk> <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of prisoners down .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that will make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then finally , woman <unk> himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you must be very , very fierce . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be <unk> .
we need to ask ourselves to bring those challenges to the challenges , the issues , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity , from our humanity is depend upon all humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a bunch of very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think it &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone &apos;s taking something that doesn &apos;t belong to him , he &apos;s not just a jehovah .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because that is , there is a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many portions of this country , and certainly in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of poverty .
and eventually , even though it &apos;s so dramatic , even though they &apos;re so dramatic , and inspiring , and so <unk> , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not about the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not being able to determine how they stretch your rich and powerful and treated , but how they manage to deal with the poor , the convicted , the <unk> .
because in that context , we first begin to begin to understand the truly amazing things that ourselves .
sometimes i &apos;m going to lose that balance . a story to the end .
sometimes i too much too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes , these ideas <unk> our thinking , in fact , in the very important way .
i <unk> these kids who were subjected to very hard punishment .
i &apos;m going to go into the <unk> and visit a client who likes to be 13 or 14 years old , and i &apos;m going to go to court as adults .
and then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn into something that he &apos;s not like ?
judge <unk> as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought , well , my god , if a judge can turn us into something different , then he must have <unk> .
well , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also wish you need one .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more accurate , i started working on a grant .
i had a media company , poor black boys than a client .
and i started talking about this . the headlines said , &quot; well , my arms , <unk> black client like a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in my sudan , i declare that failure of the <unk> and the police as well as <unk> .
there was a crazy line line about that , in this country , there &apos;s no more radical version of it in this country .
and i woke up in the morning , and i didn &apos;t know if i was going to take those crazy records , or i could just take it .
and to my horror , i hadn &apos;t just written him , but sent to the court .
and a few months went over and i had forgotten everything .
but eventually , i decided , my god , i have to go into the dish and make it a weird case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the dish .
and i thought that &apos;s going to get so painful , so painful .
finally , i got from my car and went up to the nurse .
and when i went to the dish , there was an old , black man , the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re being a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i am so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
there was something deeper into me , identity , the ability to contribute every single person to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i walked into the <unk> .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve asked these crazy <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people walked in , just because they were angry , they were angry .
i &apos;d written those crazy things .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
in <unk> , the <unk> full of people who were angry , we were talking about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors going on and off .
he always saw through the window through the window , and he was able to hear all the <unk> .
he went down and down .
eventually , this elder black man joined with a very worried <unk> in the <unk> , and they sat straight behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , judge quit a pause .
during the break , there was a <unk> protest that it felt that the janitors were in the dorms of the janitors .
this <unk> walks across to the old black black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the cafeterias ? &quot;
the old black man got on . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to talk about this young man , you don &apos;t have the target . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far beyond the universe , but it <unk> the justice system .
that we are not fully designed as human rights , unless we deal with human rights and deal with human rights .
that our entire survival of survival is to survive every single connected thing .
that we need to combine our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and especially i &apos;d like to tell those of you who are too , just say , you don &apos;t have the goal in your eyes . don &apos;t you get out of your eyes . don &apos;t you .
you &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community of the very obvious desire , to help you to help you and do something .
what can we do yet ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s all kinds of possibilities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do something about the <unk> <unk> , which is going down into the politics of the punishment .
here , california , for example , will be one billion dollars in the next five years , one billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet , <unk> percent of all <unk> don &apos;t end with a <unk> .
eighty percent of all of the <unk> won &apos;t come from trial .
there &apos;s an opportunity to do something .
this <unk> is going to try to invest money in more basic goods and invest safety .
i think there are ways there are possibilities .
over the last three decades , the u.s. <unk> <unk> is slowed down enormously .
the fact is often put into an increased relationship with the heightened <unk> .
what would they say to someone who believes this ?
well , actually , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t really change the number .
the majority of the country in the country , in this country , didn &apos;t really find it in the classroom .
it was the drug drug drug drugs against drugs .
so , the desperate high rates are getting numbers of numbers on the prisoners .
we have <unk> soldiers , from the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done &quot; <unk> , &quot; which makes people behind forever , for a discount , for the theft <unk> good , instead of that you force them to pay the things to give back .
i think we need to do more to help people get victims of an emergency victims , not less .
and i think that we can &apos;t help our models .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve really got a string of string theory .
they &apos;re inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thanks very much .
bin death : bin death is an increased decline .
# 2 : famine in somalia . speaker # 3 : <unk> by police .
four : sinister <unk> . speaker # 5 : dangerous <unk> .
6 : six <unk> . speaker # seven : seven dead .
eight : <unk> .
different speaker : <unk> , <unk> .
recession : <unk> . <unk> . egypt , egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a couple of these clips that i &apos;ve been collecting over the last six months -- but it would have been going to be the last six days , or for the last six years .
in fact , the media prefer to show us negative subjects because our minds are exactly the same attention .
and there is also a very good reason for this .
every one second every day , our senses get much more information than our brain is ever able to process more information than we can ever process .
and because there &apos;s nothing more important than our survival , the first bus station for all the information is part of our information , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our <unk> , our <unk> .
it turns out and <unk> the entire information on trying to look at all the aspects of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to think about looking for negative news .
and the old saying , &quot; if it &apos;s <unk> , demand is very true .
now , with all our other devices that seven days of our week , 24 hours a day of all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s worse .
but possibly , this is not the case .
possibly , reality is actually .
perhaps accelerating tremendous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , with a series of forces , so strong that it will become possible for us to create a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m saying we have no big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we &apos;ve already got it .
and as human beings , we have a lot better in tackling problems on a very long view , but eventually they ended up complaining .
so , let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can change the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled , which has <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has dropped by a 10th .
and what happens is that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and costs a pair of cuts to have a pair of blood pressure .
steve pinker has showed us that we live in a very peaceful time of life .
and by charles <unk> , the last 130 years has gone up from 25 percent to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget that .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expectations continuously .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
if you think that a big proportion of americans who live below poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , appliances , tv , tv , tv and automobiles have automobiles .
the richest riverside of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have dreamed of <unk> .
the basis for lots of computing technologies , and those are growing <unk> .
my great friend , ray kurzweil , has shown us that every tool that technology is going to leverage , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , has doubling everyone &apos;s 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why mobile phone in your wallet about a million times less , and is thousands faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , as big as it is -- in good places like it , war or peace , recession , recession , depression and <unk> .
that &apos;s the result of faster computers , the faster computers build computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow any of our big problems .
so , despite your <unk> <unk> on the left side , it &apos;s up there .
so the growth rate itself accelerating .
and on this graph , on the backs of moore &apos;s backs , we find a series of remarkable technologies that are available everyone .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; which is my friends in autodesk on autodesk , called sensors , networks and networks , robots , <unk> , that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> and <unk> .
how many of you have seen the victory of abrahamic supercomputer from &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was very big .
i went around the newspaper and i looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human opponent . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy , &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of the language .
imagine if these were artificial intelligence to each other .
so four years ago , ray kurzweil launched , and i &apos;m at ted a new university , singularity university .
we teach our students all these technology , so special focus on how they can be used to solve the grand challenges of humanity .
and each year , we &apos;re asking the students , businesses , products and services , depending on a decade they can affect life from billions of people .
think about it that one group of students can actually affect the lives of billions of people today .
so , 30 years ago , these ridiculous lives would have wiped out .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done right now .
and if i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean life of luxury for anyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about creating goods abundance of goods .
scarcity is <unk> , and technology is a resource force force .
here &apos;s one example .
this is the history of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> himself got <unk> .
the king of <unk> , however , got <unk> .
aluminum is the most valued metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and <unk> .
and this is why the dome of the quantum apparatus is designed from aluminum .
even though aluminum <unk> percent of the root apparatus , it does not come purely as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and oxygen .
but then , the technology technology became developed and made it so cheap , so it became so inexpensive , that we use it to use our product .
then , let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think today about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s worth more energy than we use every year .
16 <unk> energy <unk> , all <unk> tips on the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity ; it &apos;s a problem .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar power in india , 50 percent of the time to reduce -- <unk> rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar casualties in the last year by 50 percent .
there &apos;s been released on one study , which shows you that , by the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states solar , 25 cents per <unk> , compared to 15 cents in the national budget , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a dot-com , we &apos;ll also have water with water abundance .
talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan , as carl sagan , as it was on saturn , on saturn , on earth ?
he took a famous picture . what did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue gave . &quot;
because we live on an urbanizing life .
we live on a planet , which is coated by 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 99 percent saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re fighting for 0.5 percent of water on the planet , but there is also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation in this morning with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , and from many of you may have heard about it .
it can generate thousand gallons clean fresh water from different sources per day from different sources -- toxic saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- for less than two cents per gallons .
the <unk> of coca-cola has just begun to launch a big deal with a hundred units in the developing world .
and so , if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very optimistic , then coca-cola is going to apply this technology globally in <unk> countries on the planet .
this is disruptive innovation that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this also with mobile phones .
my goodness , we &apos;ll soon get the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in the developing world , to finish by the end of 2013 .
just argue that a solar system in the middle of a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better way than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton from 15 years ago .
they live in a world where information and communication have a abundance of abundance , like no one could have ever predicted .
and it comes better , the things you &apos;ve spent , and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photographer , libraries of books and music , and technology at medical diagnostic imaging imaging , now are literally <unk> and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best part of it is perhaps what we think of in the field of health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of borrowing 10 million <unk> , <unk> x prize , <unk> x prize .
so , we &apos;re calling team around the world , to combine all these technologies together in a mobile phone , so you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can see <unk> or <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , yet 25 percent of the arable land and 1.3 percent of the employees and 1.3 percent of public health .
so if this device &apos;s dna or <unk> genome , which is not known , it &apos;s going to call it the disease center and prevents a pandemic in front of its outbreak .
but now , the greatest force that will lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are on population .
we &apos;ve just seen the <unk> limit .
and just by the way , the largest oil reserves against a population is a better education and a lot of food in the world .
in 2010 , we had only connected two billion people connected to each other .
by 2020 , we beam two to five billion <unk> <unk> .
three billion new minds we have never heard before , will join global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of <unk> , i see one of the greatest economic legends of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that will go into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier , and they &apos;re getting better trained through the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and <unk> them , and they will be more more productive than they have ever seen .
so what can bring three billion , healthy , educated , <unk> , productive members of the <unk> ?
it would be done by a line of new , never before <unk> voice .
what would it be like to have the oppressed , wherever it is , is to make a voice to pay attention and make change , for the first time ?
what will bring those three billion people ?
how would it be with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams who are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things , can create extraordinary things , things that could create large companies and policies only in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program you might know about .
it &apos;s a game called the foldit .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids , to explore what the protein is going to grow .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
so , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played from university professors etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who play the game online .
and it turns out that these days contain the human <unk> better than the best supercomputer and the best supercomputer .
and so when these people came together and watched who &apos;s the best <unk> in the world , there was no <unk> , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who volunteered volunteered to work on the united states during the day , and at night , the best <unk> of the world was .
and ladies and gentlemen , what offers me deeply faith in our future is the fact that we have more than individuals to make us face the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of the <unk> .
we have the capital of the corporation .
and we &apos;ve got three billion new minds that we &apos;re working with , to address the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i am .
and perhaps i &apos;m a long enough business in business , as i &apos;m able to allow myself to give it a little bit of my own <unk> to make this possible .
but before i go to the actual talk of my speech , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are approaching the <unk> and moving us to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; looks very soon and turns about statistics and order to create a great special team .
i &apos;m going to suggest i &apos;m about a statistics that i &apos;m hoping most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a 300 when a swing hit 300 .
that means that the player is safe from 10 hitting 10 .
so that &apos;s going to beat the ball into the <unk> , and he &apos;s going to come up , and who is trying to throw the ball into the first base , didn &apos;t do it in time , and the runners has been in sure .
three from 10 from 10 times 10 from 10 from 10 .
do you know how to call a <unk> <unk> baseball game ?
well , perhaps well , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
this is one of the tenets of the book , safely in the way .
<unk> , like ted williams <unk> <unk> , and the last <unk> <unk> player meet during a <unk> season over 400 times .
so , let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , which i feel powerless about , or perhaps a little bit more comfortable after that i talked about it with you about it .
suppose you have a dot-com , and you &apos;re calling to a <unk> , whose 400 <unk> of it is in <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine living in a remote neighborhood , and you &apos;ve got a beloved people with <unk> <unk> , and her chief <unk> <unk> that leads to a <unk> whose neighborhood is <unk> at 200 .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better better than that year . it &apos;s on the side of branch .
and she &apos;s beating a <unk> .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the <unk> for a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , should be a corporate officer ?
1,000 , very well .
the truth is , nobody knows in the entire medicine , which is a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
what we do though is , we included each of them , including me , into the world .
never make a mistake , but no one does worry about the details of how to do this .
and this is the message i took in medicine .
i was an compulsively <unk> student .
in high school , one of the <unk> said that brian <unk> was going to learn for a <unk> .
and so it was too .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the nurses <unk> in the <unk> general hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my specialty , i learned the origins and the tail and the tail every <unk> , every branch of every artery , which <unk> off of the aorta , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i knew even the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the kind of time i collected more and more .
and i was good at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i left medical school with the impressions i knew if i knew everything , and everything was done , or as as as as possible as possible , as possible as possible , that i was really immune to that type of errors .
and it worked for a while , until i met a lot of a printer .
i was <unk> at a hospital school teacher in toronto as a woman being brought into the factory centers of the hospital .
at that moment , i was appointed the <unk> layer at the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment when the <unk> <unk> effort was to look at the masking movement .
and feedback on my checklist .
i studied my wife &apos;s signature , and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she made psychotic sounds .
and as i sat down with <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that they had <unk> <unk> .
so , this is a condition in which the heart is failing , instead of taking all blood up , put a part of the blood in the lungs , and filling it up and filling it up , and that &apos;s why the <unk> arrived .
and that was not a difficult diagnostic response .
i put them and i did it on the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i used to take her medicine to take advantage of the heart from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water adventures , so they called the liquid <unk> .
and for about two and a half to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and there i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually i made two errors .
i sent them back home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take on the receiver and did what i would have been able to have , which would have been a phone call in my <unk> , so that he had had a chance to have a chance of trying to do a physical image .
and he knew it , and he &apos;d been able to <unk> additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want the <unk> doctor .
perhaps i wanted to do so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i knew so , and so i would be able to talk to my patients without having to contact it with my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home , i &apos;m sending a little bit of a voice in me trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , what i really lacked was the nurse when i asked the nurse , which is to say , &quot; do you think it &apos;s ok if you &apos;re going to go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember it as though it was yesterday .
so i got the bruises and i got an ambulance and <unk> , and they took it home .
and then i went back into the work .
the rest of the day , the evening , i had this unfortunate feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work on .
and at the end of the day , i packed my stuff , <unk> the hospital , and went to home with the car , when i was doing something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went through my <unk> <unk> on my way home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , and not the sister who had seen after wife &apos;s desk , but another three words , and those three words are terrified of me , and those three words , most of which i know .
other people fear that too , but the <unk> is very special because we see patients just as fleeting .
three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients that sent them back home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in these certain <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back back and die .
about an hour after which i &apos;d sent her home to her home , collapsed , her and her family , and her family called her back up on the <unk> with a blood pressure from 50 , that &apos;s a dangerous blood geek .
she hardly breath and became blue <unk> .
and the <unk> did all the strands .
they gave her <unk> .
they called them up to the <unk> .
i was in shock , and i was in the inner <unk> .
and i go through this rollercoaster because they moved to the <unk> ward , and i hoped they were gonna recover .
and after two days , three days realized she never had disappeared again .
she hadn &apos;t suffered a <unk> nazi officer .
your family got together .
and then over the course of the next eight or nine days , they went through the <unk> .
on the morning day you &apos;ll walk her -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;d never forget the name of the mermaid never forget .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i went out and i learned about the first time the junk food , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , zimbabwe , not the kinds of healthy shame you feel , because you couldn &apos;t talk to your colleagues about it .
you know all the healthy shame , if you &apos;re a secret from the best friend &apos;s top , and then you get the best friend you face , and you get a terrible discussion , when you end up with a very bad discussion , you &apos;ll never do it again .
if you do <unk> , and you never make the mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of incubation shame .
the junk kind of stuff i &apos;m talking about is the one in the brain is doing something in the heart .
it &apos;s the one who doesn &apos;t say what you &apos;re doing is bad , but it &apos;s a bad thing to yourself .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for the reason why my favorite , he was very gentle .
he was talking about the family , and i &apos;m sure that it was <unk> , and i &apos;m not going to be sued that i was going to be sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i <unk> them ?
and then my worst moments : how did i make a stupid mistake ?
why am i going into medicine ?
slowly but it certainly took it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun breaks out , and i said maybe i could feel better again .
and i was upset with myself that if i had my effort extending my effort to perfection , and i would never make a mistake that the vote could escape .
and they did it .
and i continued to work on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i was working in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of los hurry and i was in hurry .
he always popped up there .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and then when he walked out of the door , he showed himself his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my office , and my <unk> asked me on a conversation in her office .
and she said those three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he had a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can google that , but it &apos;s not inflammation from the <unk> cube to the top , and it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> .
and luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went again through the same <unk> of shame and self-doubt , felt me and went back to the work to do it again and again and again and again .
in a <unk> zone , i saw two times missing .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially when you realize that you &apos;re working in a hospital , that &apos;s only 14 of 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i won &apos;t send them back home , and i certainly didn &apos;t have any qualifications in their treatment .
at one point , i thought he had <unk> .
i hate the <unk> of my feet , and when it was <unk> , my colleague at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> <unk> , in the lower right , and called the heath hen .
the other one had strong constipation .
i started <unk> around him too , and i asked him to do it also as well as i did him too .
and indeed , he and when he got a <unk> in the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was good for them .
both of these cases <unk> me on me .
and i would be happy to say that my worst mistake was only happened in the first five years , what many of my colleagues say , but it &apos;s ridiculous .
some of my studies happened in the last five years .
by ourselves , humbled and without support .
here &apos;s a problem : if i can &apos;t finish my mistake and talk about them , if i can &apos;t find the little voices that tell me what happened , how can i then share it with my colleagues ?
how can i tell you my fault , so you can &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i put in a room -- like right now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you know the last time from someone who was talking about <unk> talking about <unk> ?
oh , you &apos;re going to go to a cocktail party party , and you &apos;re going to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear someone else about your own mistakes .
so , if i went into a room full of colleagues and asking your immediate support for your immediate support and started telling you what i told you , i wouldn &apos;t really reach the end of the second story before it was going to change the issue and the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , i &apos;d taken someone off in my hospital with someone who &apos;d taken off the wrong leg , then they trust me , i would have seen him in the eyes .
this is the system in which we live .
it &apos;s totally deny errors .
there &apos;s a system in which there &apos;s two basic positions -- those who make errors are made , and those of you who don &apos;t do it , those <unk> <unk> , and restriction with good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response to that kind of antibodies that worries people to attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we &apos;re looking for those to make errors out of medicine , they maintain a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medicine and journalism , i have a personal medical study on medical errors and titles , for so everything i did for the first article , which i write for the toronto star in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black art , black art .
and what i learned , is that mistake is absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day in which one of 10 steps either is either a false or wrong thing , in the opinion of <unk> , and always getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more than that .
so in this state , about 80,000 canadians , they die of <unk> <unk> .
in the united states , the institute of medicine holds the number of 100,000 .
these are rounded numbers , because we don &apos;t look at the problem on the way we think it &apos;s supposed to be .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> healthcare system in the field of medical school , which is doubling , for two to three years , we cannot keep up with it .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we cannot get him off .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect cure for a patient with pain pain .
and then i &apos;m going to take the same patient with <unk> , and i &apos;m going to make it <unk> , and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a breath , and all of a sudden , the story is <unk> with disdain .
i &apos;m not going to take the same direction .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always make things like that .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not telling me their symptoms always in the same way .
all those things are inevitable .
so , if you take the system as well as i &apos;m taught it , and all of the sudden <unk> <unk> , and then finally there &apos;s no longer left .
and do you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black style , &quot; i said , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah .
and then your pupils , you know , you &apos;ve figured out your head , and then you look down and <unk> , and you &apos;re going to start looking at your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i <unk> . &quot;
what they need is an environment they need to do with it .
what they need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a physician .
the <unk> doctor is a person who knows his humanity , accept them , is not proud to make mistakes , but somehow everything from them to learn so that it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they encourage other people to talk to their mistakes .
and they &apos;re showing others their fault , not by <unk> , but in a supportive supportive way that all of these benefits .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill in the system with life , and if that is so , people also make mistakes from time too .
so that the system is able to create <unk> , which is the easiest way to make people inevitable , and it allows people to create supportive spaces , in which everybody who sees health care , they can actually address things , and that particular thing for people like me to do . and that particular thing for people like me .
my name is brian &apos; american .
i am the newly redefined physician .
i &apos;m a person . i do errors .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best of it to pass it on other people .
i don &apos;t know what they think about me , but i can live with it .
so , let me close with three my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little bit , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can use this idea in one minute , i &apos;m going to tell you about three stories in order to take your time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;s got <unk> here .
you might think that he &apos;s <unk> , but it &apos;s not true .
in fact , he gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a <unk> .
until the &apos; 80s in &apos; 80s , he got into big style .
now he &apos;s listed on the red list .
this is a lot of times from the galapagos or many times from the galapagos or in other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we always think they &apos;d be initially .
the <unk> describe they still describe it as pristine .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is supposed to be another concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was living in 1971 a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there , because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought , i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible reaction , and i felt really disconnected from there .
it was my first <unk> .
you see , as you can see , the pigeon used by <unk> and by a few rogue <unk> .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> dynasty .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very eclectic , and these fishermen lived well lived well in ghana .
when i got home 27 years later , the fish had shrunk half of its size since half its size .
compare them to five inches .
they had been genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had also been the luck to be there .
so there &apos;s nothing changed , and yet everything has changed everything .
my third story tells me from my childhood <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
back in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe a lot of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> countries , who caught a hundred fish fish , industrial fishing , the industrial fishery of this rather ugly ship called <unk> .
and i went on and we did it , and we did it all throughout the <unk> <unk> and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we got there .
now , i know it was the cause of the sea .
ninety percent of our <unk> were tied together , other animals , who are linked to the cause of the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little points there on the webcam , the <unk> , were <unk> .
basically , the reason the oceans got on deck and then became <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition is very short .
within a year , you get a survey by and then starts with the commercial fishery .
and the reason is going to change . -- in this case -- a hard reason or a soft corals gets crap crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they throw it away , because they were dead .
once again , we started living a living animal .
she wasn &apos;t yet <unk> .
and then they wanted to kill them , because they wanted to eat them good .
and in fact , this mountain of undisturbed every time of germs , when they enter into areas where they &apos;ve never been dived into that .
but it won &apos;t documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we call our <unk> at the new level , and we don &apos;t call it in memories of what was there .
if you <unk> it , here &apos;s what happens .
on the y-axis , there are a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
with the time it &apos;s changing , because it &apos;s changing , because people are doing , of course , their actions are quite natural .
each generation look at the images they record at the beginning of their conscious life , as the conscience and everything from it .
and the difference will then be seen as a mutation .
but they don &apos;t take the previous loss .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the <unk> remains .
and that is , in fact , <unk> , our goal .
we want to get things that vanished have vanished or things that are not longer as they were .
you might think that the problem went to people who are sure that they lived in <unk> societies , killing animals , and only after a group of generations were realized what they had done .
because obviously , one of the animal is going to get very common , first of all , before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t lose any common diversity in common animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore , it won &apos;t be seen as a huge loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re getting rarer because we &apos;re going to catch them .
there &apos;s little fish left over there , and we think this is the <unk> .
the question is why people accept the people .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was differently .
of course , many people , scientists , will admit that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to tell it , because the evidence , as they were in a previous shape , are not as much as they would like to describe the evidence .
so , for example , the anecdote is that the report of a <unk> like the report of a <unk> like that in this neighborhood can &apos;t be used , or by <unk> , or not <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know about the past , even though we live in eastern societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous role that can play a marine reserve .
because what we do by marine reserves is basically the past .
we bring back the past , which people cannot understand , because they have changed themselves , because they have changed themselves , and they are very low .
so , people can see the people who are going to see a marine reserve , and they can benefit from the insight that they have to <unk> their <unk> .
what about the people who is not possible , because they have no access -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
here , i think , the art and the movie may fill the gap , and eventually simulations .
this is simulating the simulation of chesapeake bay .
there were 500 years ago there -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> may remind you of &quot; avatar &quot; avatar .
when they think of the &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people got it so touched -- aside from the <unk> , why were they so touched by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s something that was lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so , my urging , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is to look at &quot; avatar ii &quot; in order of water .
thanks very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in the mid- &apos; 80s , you had to do when you owned a typewriter , you have to register it in the government .
they also had to register a copy of <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for that , the government could trace track of where a text came from .
they found an article with <unk> <unk> , they could detect the creator of that thought .
and in the west , in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how someone could do something like this , and how much that would cost the free line of speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re now buying a new <unk> of mine in the year 2011 , and plot one side , and then this site turns yellow yellow <unk> on every side of the page , in a pattern that &apos;s unambiguous on them and its <unk> .
this is happening today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem a lot of them thinking about it .
and that was an example of how our own government governments filed the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main elements of the world today .
so , let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really going on in the world : we can divide those attacks into categories .
we have three main stages .
there &apos;s <unk> .
so , for example here , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of chemists are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of <unk> , <unk> , that they have spent their money on attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
stephen watt .
<unk> <unk> .
this is matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
so , these people have gone online , but they &apos;ve got illegal braking , so they &apos;ve used it to put money from our local enemies , for example , as we go off our <unk> , or even <unk> , who we &apos;ve pulled out of the input on the <unk> , whereas we &apos;re shopping about a user infected computer .
the u.s. intelligence analyst , two months ago , the swiss account account of mr. jain jain here , and on this account account were <unk> million u.s. dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is at free feet , the <unk> is unknown .
and i &apos;ll claim that today is more likely that we &apos;ll become victims of an <unk> as a <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
most of the crime is going to place most crime online .
the second biggest exporter we can see today aren &apos;t funded by money .
they &apos;re done by something else -- whatever , one opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last dozen months and has become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three main characteristics : criminals who are doing it for the money , <unk> how anonymous they are doing resistance , but the last group is nations , governments that lead the attacks of the attacks .
there are cases like this , like <unk> .
it &apos;s a model , what happens when governments are able to attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a democrat from the usa -- and , in fact , it was .
in the past , it had to register <unk> , because <unk> was hacked .
someone has been hacked and the system had been hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior <unk> of this group , if they had died , had died because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was yes .
now , how does people die in a string of one like this ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> roasting .
what do you do with <unk> ?
well , a certificate you need to do when you &apos;re a website with <unk> , with <unk> of service , for example .
now , we &apos;re all using it , or a lot of us , gmail or one of your businesses , but these services are very common in <unk> states like iran , because they know that they can give people more trust than local health services , and they can &apos;t be restrained with <unk> , so that the local government can &apos;t go into your conversation .
but you can yet , if you turn yourself into a foreign foreign foreign foreign .
<unk> <unk> and fake <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in the event of <unk> .
so what about the arab spring and the things that , for example , is happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , in egypt , the momentum in april of 2011 , the headquarters &apos; headquarters are <unk> <unk> , and they discovered a lot of work .
in these files , a folder was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , notes from one company in germany , who used to sell a couple of programs that had to sell a couple of programs that they could detect -- every great sign of the egyptian citizens could silks .
they had sold this program for <unk> dollars to the egyptian government .
and the <unk> is right here .
so , western governments <unk> governments with <unk> donors can do that against their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a couple of weeks ago , so-called a couple of weeks ago of so-called <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to create their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a <unk> <unk> , almost safety your phone bills .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap into their <unk> <unk> .
they use resources like the <unk> to <unk> their computers with a <unk> who allows them to use their entire communications , their <unk> <unk> .
so if we continue thinking about stuff like this , the apparent answer of people , &quot; ok , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t deal with me because i &apos;m a privileged citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has remained given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and while we today , in 2011 , our government likes to trust our government , though , is every right that we &apos;ll make forever .
and trust , we &apos;re blind , we &apos;re blind to every future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have faced with the next 50 years .
it might seem odd to them , but i am a big fan of <unk> .
and the first offshore drills were produced , and <unk> of a simple idea : <unk> out of cement , <unk> out of cement with the curtain that they fit .
<unk> became very rapidly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they were able to build things that were bigger than us , buildings , bridges , one lump for the other .
basically , the <unk> was the <unk> of our time on the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego guys came out with this .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within a few years , the lego in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego blocks made it for everyone .
lego is basically the <unk> , the grand in the world , took out of a building block for our imagination .
in the same year in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution , announced the next revolution .
the transistor was a little <unk> that <unk> us from a world of static , <unk> building blocks of a world in which everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , the transistor allows us to build a lot more complex , more complex loops , one lump for the other .
but there &apos;s a toyota <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i don &apos;t fully accept that the building block of our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change it .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore the idea of how to build the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing computer models .
let me show you how they work .
so , <unk> are electronic <unk> that have a specific function of function .
they &apos;re disembodied , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best part is they &apos;re joining together with magnets together .
so they can &apos;t put them together in front of them .
the bricks are <unk> .
green is <unk> , blue is electricity , pink is the input and orange is cable .
so everything you have to do is link one blue and one green one , and you can build a pretty fast bigger carbon calculator .
they add one blue to one green , and they can make light .
you can put a wall in between , and you can put a little bit into it .
take the wall out to the side of a golf ball , which is here , and they did a little <unk> .
add it to an additional effect on an extra wing and they have created a <unk> algorithm .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , which is actually quite powerful in fact .
instead of being able to code , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to look at them with simple , intuitive gestures to code .
so to speed that flash , or slow it down , just turn it on this button and slow it down , and it does slow down faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that there &apos;s a growing library .
we &apos;re going to bring every single interactions on this planet in the world .
lights , notes , <unk> , appliances , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread kids &apos; kids &apos; children , and you &apos;ll see them playing games with them .
and it was an unbelievable experience .
the most beautiful thing is , as you start to understand the electronics in your everyday life , and you &apos;re not learning in school .
for example , a <unk> works , or why the doors of <unk> <unk> , or like a ipod responds to touch .
we also brought <unk> also into <unk> .
so we had a designer , for example , designers with no experience of play in the electronic things that started playing with materials .
here we see , <unk> , paper and water water , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we went out to risd , and we gave them a bunch of designers who had no technical experience -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , which they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my favorite device .
it &apos;s a emancipation of play-dough , the fear of play-dough in the dark .
for these <unk> , <unk> became another material , electronics became simply another material .
and we want to make this material for everybody else .
so hannah &apos;s open source is open source .
you can go on to the website , all of the main download download and make them self-assembling .
we want to get the world of the creators , the inventor , the inventor , because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so , pull them off and start thinking about them .
thank you very much .
