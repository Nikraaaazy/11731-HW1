now why does this matter to human health ?
here &apos;s a plot of dolphins in the bay bay area .
and i remember sitting on my desk in my desk and thought , &quot; now i know it . what a great scientific scientific discovery was , &quot; but it was so horrible .
they &apos;re always being closed in the world all over the world , and i think that &apos;s kind of closed from the same reason , and i think we &apos;re going to let it go out .
in the beginning , i showed you how heavily we formed the ecosystem &apos;s ecosystem bay from pollution and the <unk> and all kinds of stuff .
<unk> -- <unk> .
at the same time , his mother had asked him , &quot; do you know the book of michael <unk> ? &quot;

clay shirky , this great <unk> of all , has the condition being asked by the <unk> , in such a wonderful fashion .
today , there &apos;s so many new foundations , the investments and investments that bring people together together , together for a purpose in a context , in a bigger context .
and i &apos;m optimistic , because not only the philanthropy is <unk> from philanthropy , even other parts of the social media business business business business , doing business business as business as business , business as usual .
i mean , i guess what a lot of this is near me . it &apos;s in my office , because i always felt a mystic connection to those two guys , i &apos;ve never learned of them .
my own research on cell phone and <unk> shows that 80 percent of all the phone calls are actually going to go to four people . eighty percent .
whenever they have a moment , they &apos;re joining each other .
and in modern terms of modern bureaucracy , a very hungarian way , where there was a clear disconnect between the private environment and public health .
we &apos;re worried that instant messaging , texting , facebook of the <unk> intimacy , but <unk> <unk> research shows how people can promote non-zero-sum more flexible relationships to people like remoteness and <unk> .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles developed -- is how we think the first autonomous <unk> of the world .
so , for instance , the limbic brain tends to create a bunch of co-developers .
no challenging task .
spend , spend , spend about 10 dollars a year from trying to bring people into jail .
her family lives since eight generations in a city called <unk> , west virginia .

and he won , sometimes , you don &apos;t feel it , in los angeles in los angeles -- one reason to kill l.a. -- that in the 1940s .
i started my company to help communities around the country , using their existing potential , to improve the entire lives of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have children , you &apos;re not going to understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people discovering sometime in adulthood , &quot; community &quot; for themselves .
it always takes time .
it &apos;s just kind of blame for a number of <unk> against a person , and someone with down down down down down down down down down down down down down , is not a person . &quot;
to <unk> people , it &apos;s not too far .
but i found myself out that i &apos;m the kids i &apos;m born with , so love that i don &apos;t want to live with me a life without you .
he wouldn &apos;t really reach out his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i have a lot of luck .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there are them .
so this is earlier in 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , has a lot of you know , dimitri and built from us in nigeria , just as it was connected to internet .
think about it -- because there are other people like bill gates , who said , &quot; man , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
latin is also quite rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have to make sure that we can &apos;t integrate any additional targets to keep the prices down below the bottom .
for a cleaner , my apartment is about as wondrous as outer space .
and we can take care of the interests of <unk> .
so , i was told by a fiscal cliff , so i was told , although i don &apos;t know what the party is doing , or attacks .
wealth will be people who are not supposed to be referred to as <unk> .
in terms of taxes , there are greater opposition opposition .
none of those important theories was a full success .
we have fear that the world is watching .
and while a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something that was really intrigued with me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , this is happening -- light into the dark in six seconds .
i look at their faces very closely .
this is not an expression of joy .
this lady actually demonstrates a particularly aggressive face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it turns light on it , so if you move it , it gets a <unk> object , even though it &apos;s still standing on it -- just by how brilliant it is done by the <unk> .
i had to change that part , but only by a millimeter .
and one of the things i showed you before , of course , was a very complex .
it &apos;s gaining it or loses it at that moment .
the emotional band between this object and shapes them , is a <unk> <unk> , which is going to happen before they even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet those choice .
it &apos;s also a notion that we have forgotten .
i think it would return to the tradition of how to return .
again , we don &apos;t think that .
and at the end of the semester , they stand everyone on and they say , &quot; thank you plato , thank you , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t tell you that artists should not tell their clitoris , because when they destroy them , it destroyed the magic and we might find it .
art is one of the tools we used to make our society .
we may not agree with what religions wants us to teach us , but we can admire the institutional kind of admire that they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i meet , like many of them , people say , &quot; isn &apos;t something bigger than us , another one ? &quot;
because when you think too 90 percent , because you have a similar vision on so many things , and you get polite other people &apos;s wager .
so , inspired me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- by siberia , in some underground mines , in north america , in north america , in fact , to antarctica and even to the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest ocean in the world . it &apos;s 500 kilometers long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but this is called the <unk> big telescope .
this hut was by robert <unk> scott and his men when they went to antarctica on their first expedition , to the south expedition to the south pole .
think of it , these whole <unk> people in extreme cold , <unk> temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i finally come back to it .
what people are doing first is confounded by the book they &apos;re looking for in the book , and they &apos;re kind of fun about the book , and they &apos;re doing fun .
it was quite a lot of people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve got the 10 cents each side by working with big volume , if we &apos;re working with big volume .
i &apos;m still not sure what <unk> is alive .
a day welcome to about two or three <unk> .
at 15 dollars an hour video and about 150 or 150 bucks an hour , we can put materials on top of it , and we can put it on the net .
the question is , is this the world we want to live in ?
flowers will come in <unk> .
we all know that the earth has problems .
by the way , by spores , they <unk> them .
when they walk through the landscape , they beam it up into their shoes and try to respond with the <unk> .
all right through all the <unk> .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a very extraordinarily rarer <unk> .
i did something that didn &apos;t have done differently .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you put earth on earth and water , and you have both <unk> and <unk> fungi , as well as the spores , as well .
i also lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : life is malleable enough ?
i kind of ate myself kind of <unk> myself .
and the doctor was studied to make sure whether it was us really well .
and all of them walked into me .
<unk> , in the earlier part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are incredibly beautiful and incredibly complex , and i have no idea how to make people living there .
this , this beautiful picture , is the amazon .
this is actually a moose .
i had to think about it , as you cut pressure and cut , but also about how you choose the right person coming into a chain .
you put the emancipation , you put blood , you put blood down , you put it under the microscope , put it under the microscope , put it down underneath the culture , put it into the culture , injected into it .
but we need a <unk> pit pit crews for patients .
and so it feels sometimes the drug sometimes .
we looked at <unk> families , and we looked at the <unk> <unk> , and we discovered that they have technology and education , and then they have something to do . they have checklists .
and it just kind of spreading it out .
so , this is really complicated many bees , and that &apos;s really important .
so that means that , in fact , customers can replace their dead people very well , and so they could keep these losses .
they take their families and <unk> their families twice the year for twice a year .
honeybees are but in the minority .
if we &apos;re taking a cave in new york with one of 15,000 soldiers , we &apos;re still 1,000 . this is as if san francisco within three years is the population of <unk> .
now , don &apos;t all of us have meadows and lawns , which we can turn , and so naturally , you can always put a meadow in a meadow in a dish .
and i whistled in my wife &apos;s holy evening with my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and others , do it -- i thought i &apos;d do it again , and i &apos;ll do it again , and won again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the largest creature on our planet planet , is wrong , totally false .
during the day , they flip their leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day they will open up -- then there &apos;s a lot more movement .

it &apos;s a wonderful way of trying to spend a <unk> in a sports stadium .
and the idea is still in the beginning , but looks like this .

now , kids aren &apos;t <unk> yet , they &apos;re a special case .
they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
these are discovered by natural selection &apos;s genius , incredibly awesome .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this program .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve heard this guy .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think .
well maybe we should take it metaphorically .
it &apos;s the devil &apos;s speaking . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , each of them is an individual chord .
guys , if you understand nothing out of this talk , trying to do with careful listening , and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with headphones is the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> .

but instead , i found a country that was completely assumed , which was completely ideological and i couldn &apos;t fit more .
that iran used to be an i.p. society , and we had a democracy democracy , and we have created this democracy from the american government and the u.k. government .
i stand here to say that the iranian ladies have found a new voice , and their voice gives me my voice .

and the man said , &quot; well , beautiful <unk> , what ? &quot;

and i created a system to churn out medical isotopes .
all right , &quot; i am more than my genes -- all together .
i haven &apos;t asked them to do it , because it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true , but to remind you of it .
they contain a molecule that we used as input .
and this is just a generic device . it &apos;s much smaller than a human <unk> .
well , nerve cells , like trees , are able to grow new branches , grow new branches and restore old .
and we can even talk about biofuels .
if you look at those numbers , you can easily guarantee that there &apos;s a big basis for <unk> in the brain .

he &apos;s basically working on music video and commercials with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we have a quick experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
as he did , he noticed an unexpected thing .

even better light and water pollution and whatnot , the peak rate cuts to a third .
in about 20 years , private <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> solar panels on your roofs and slower losses on your roofs .
and with whatever we replace it , it will cost about 6 trillion dollars in <unk> -- we &apos;re going to buy more of it , which we have or nuclear proliferation , or eventually , or renewable nuclear power , or renewable , which is more or less centralized .
so on results , and not incentives , to focus , can lead to <unk> , and conflict can lead to the <unk> solution of america .
later , i realized what i was eating , two <unk> of his whole family member of his family .
so , this very simple show shows that donors are going to go in places where the least kids don &apos;t go to school , not funded schools , so aid can address the people you most need ?

it looks like a mars rover rover on mars .
so , science on one side has a very rational way of doing its environment , whereas art on the other side , usually has a emotional approach to its environment .
now , i have a phantom <unk> over here to show you that .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the vet became <unk> by a little girl whose body had been burned .

and i really learned that , the more challenging the challenge , the bigger one of the special performance , when you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but that wasn &apos;t falling without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green blanket on the horizon , which makes you very nervous because of the rising sea level .

this is french science .
well , let &apos;s go .
so , if you look at these truck , it &apos;s the largest truck of its kind on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest growing and the fastest growing material of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada &apos;s now the number three is in terms per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t just think of what a soul does to do .
by doing this , we remove a big part of our largest oil production and replacing it with the most greenhouse greenhouse gas emissions from the future .
the <unk> of her work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and have the millions of indian women every day on their forehead , and there &apos;s a ritual that is deeply related to the institution of marriage .

so i started to look at my first tedtalk that we should spend a planet 10 billion hours per week playing games with video games .
only 30 minutes <unk> a day for a significant improvements in mood and <unk> increase the joy of joy .

there are four kinds of starches , or resilience inherent with post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically available things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need a trauma .
through more practice they become empowered .
here &apos;s another secret to them : if you shake someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , and then crashed will get up in your blood supply , which is &quot; <unk> . &quot;

and your individual imagination , and your work with this mathematical way .
this particular <unk> property -- consciousness -- is my opinion according to the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually eventually hopefully hopefully we will understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is reason to be understood at <unk> &apos;s mind , and when he sees his mother , grabs his delusional delusional and he says , it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area will have damage , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs -- nothing is going to happen , just like regular people , but when i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mother , the <unk> activity is low .
he knows his arm is not there . nonetheless it is a persuasive , <unk> experience .
perhaps you can &apos;t solve the command , the spasm of phantom the phantom .

and some stars die in spectacular supernova explosions , who left these remains .
on the right side , gravity has the gravity . einstein has explained that .
and beyond that , they create new kinds of change .
it was still too early on , but he was a moral conscience , an inspiring for scientists who were worried about the control of weapons .

and then we asked them again , how happy they were .
but a lot of different motivations .
these are <unk> in belgium .
the teams that we used to spend on each other to add it to each other teams and <unk> in the end , actually the league .

the map of port-au-prince ended up in the end of 2009 , not as good as they could possibly have , not as well as the map of california .
here &apos;s the trick .
and she said , she said , &quot; he was not an artifact . &quot;
and that system wants the status quo , also the status quo and the status of an accountable government .
so it &apos;s not that my issue is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
vilayanur lessig : we , citizens , need to get the republic of the republic .

this is on my pen . &quot;
everyone &apos;s just a little bit ridiculous .
i don &apos;t want to say that law entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the <unk> edge .
if you look in north america , these are the same as many things in the united states each other , and they &apos;re ignorant each other . they ignore each other .
so , each of your <unk> hangs on this is based on , the <unk> , which has the 10,000 independent cells , from which every compass , has an electronic rhythm -- low tension -- low tension to the pump for pumps .
they &apos;ve been working for a while , but then curves apart .
so i &apos;d like to show you a couple of interviews with people who are at the opening on the opening , and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually think of a metronome , but we &apos;re all trying to do it -- we &apos;re going to go ahead and walk back into it .
so , this is just a couple of tons of tons , so you &apos;re going to go pretty fast .
but the most fundamental scientist in its area .

pay attention to your body fluids ! this is not right .
perhaps even more queen , one lady ? -- thank you .
you &apos;ve only tried two concepts -- two in the u.s. , and one on the russians .
madness . i have to talk briefly about innovation dynamic -- these things develop , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re going to die through something .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go off , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my timetable .
i mean something really interesting is going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development development system .

but the real question is , how good works this in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a magnetic pulse . it prevents angiogenesis in a very effective way .
but more interestingly from the study of the study , the men who developed <unk> , who have taken more tomato tomato sauce , actually had lower blood vessels that have gone through their cancer .

he &apos;s one of five children .
so , i &apos;ve showed you that we can use it in the circuits in terms of depression .
we &apos;re able to begin to understand what these circuits are and what the brain systems are in the clinical symptoms and symptoms of those diseases are responsible .
evolution operates more like a golf ball than an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at a man &apos;s leg , like richard , or a crab , or a crab or a crab , the relative <unk> of that feather , is equal to everyone that we &apos;ve seen yet .
ok . and the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s amazing , students did it , and they couldn &apos;t tell it .
he &apos;s doing it with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hairs as a model , and we put them together with another fellow colleagues from berkeley .
showed that by the <unk> <unk> , two thirds of the <unk> men have had children but only a third of the most women women do .
on the monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew at this conference .

thanks very much .
what brunel , as he said , for his passengers , was the experience of the landscape through the landscape .

this is a spanish architect and designer .
color can <unk> <unk> , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it has given me some suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we &apos;re all <unk> and building a few installations .
the effort that has played the city for public spaces , is important , almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french words .
he said , &quot; well , there are more girls there . &quot;
and it ended up like me , after some <unk> and <unk> , on the creation of the chair , which i ended up showing you the same .
he said she &apos;s one of the new , better chairs .
or they draw them up into the desired position .
and then i knew from experience , and when i went into the offices , when i was in the office , where there were no one on the idea that never anyone would come on the idea , <unk> , to turn the needle into place , to put the head in place to make it in place .
and dengue fever has spread virally .
just two days ago , i can &apos;t remember anymore , i &apos;ve been reading myself in a research review , that <unk> the first cloned <unk> , about a 52 college student , with about 70,000 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so it wasn &apos;t the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : meet males , females , lots of roads .
so , <unk> isn &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i remove myself hardly even though i &apos;m a full-time historian .
look at the available data .
well , our cellphones can now build a story of our <unk> apparatus .
bill <unk> : your health depend on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
for the easy reason , there &apos;s nobody else talking about it .
as the dawn explained , they move plants from water from water from the soil .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a series of nature that the discussion about the phosphorus phosphorus phosphorus phosphorus phosphorus phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it goes out of that way .
and instead of 100 percent of 100 percent , we take one from 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and we have a functioning technology , some of the scientific <unk> that we put on the world &apos;s <unk> .
and he was a so-called , peter <unk> : he was all <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws instead of looking at the norms , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that these individual stages are repeated , but they &apos;re repeated without being <unk> .
as an architect , i just think about the relationship between the parts and the whole , but in terms of doing something , it becomes more ticklish for companies .
we &apos;re <unk> at the scale of the scale of the building , where we could build the five towers , but they &apos;re all over the 60 floor leads to a single <unk> mass of join together .
let &apos;s go back again , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape actually looks quite a bit more like <unk> .
the difference is especially in <unk> in the desert , or perhaps <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic trash there , lots of things that have been discarded , and now are the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and we have doubled in the world , just except fertilizers that have huge problems on water quality , in rivers , there are lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important facet , and it &apos;s also the most important food source .
but we can do it , and there are opportunities .
irrigation irrigation is the largest car-sharing company on the <unk> .
they need to work together .
so -- what is actually the system of system d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the entire system , no steering system , no steering system .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological rules to add up -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
so , here we <unk> , or cut the nerve free , from small parts of the <unk> and left others , we gave us our <unk> -- signal , two other people that gave us our hand -- signal . two others that gave us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode soda and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and this is our goal -- to do something more clinically <unk> .
this is jesse and he &apos;s got a <unk> .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa has been increasing , because there are <unk> million people living there with hiv , which are valued 70 percent of the 30 million people worldwide , who are infected by the world .
now , governments in this place have to develop effective targets for ethical parts in the clinical trial that are authorized in the different developing countries that are allowed to be obtained by the government and the study of the study .
the fundamental problems facing which we face is a very high consumerism and a lot of people .
so you meet all the criteria that people usually liked .
so , you see , you can see this flow north -- the <unk> in this case -- it goes to the galapagos -- that goes to the galapagos , and this <unk> , the <unk> , which is going to come up with the galapagos .
we also know that not only is cancer risk , but it was also threatened by the magellanic and other people .
so i want to show you now that penguins will be moved in <unk> .
turbo &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , to pat his <unk> on the door , and we put it in there , and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that &apos;s going to come very comfortable with it .
now , here is a fundamental problem we have not solved : our basic political geography .
these two are quite a long line .
again , as the case of mongolia , china has not dropped russia . it cuts it .
for <unk> countries , china is reduced to china , so that <unk> and cambodia are able to sell themselves , and they could sell to china , to china , to china , to china , to china , to china .
what i want to show you is what i call <unk> , day after day .
these two arrows make an arch , a bow of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bench to the hamas bench in the hamas bench .
a lot of them .
so what comes next ? what is the future of european union ?
there are 53 countries and certainly most of the suspect straight lines on the map .
this dream has its time .
does it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem that way .
ok .
and the hormone support system enhances growth .
so , as a hormone finally , a hormone wants to inhibit the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and <unk> hormones are active hormones that are active under harsh circumstances -- in good times -- when food is still there , and not a lot of stresses in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on the lifespan of people .
and basically , you could fit the genes .
so , it &apos;s possible that the process of which i was talking about , which is going to happen very rapidly in the worm , for example , in a bird &apos;s atmosphere , for example , a bird so that the bird can live a lot longer .
you &apos;re never going to see an ad like this , because nike wants to buy you your shoes .
they &apos;re all about the hero , the <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a <unk> website .
this view is that a lot of <unk> <unk> how prozac in the brain are actually changing the chemistry of the brain , as if in fact , the brain of the soup of chemical soup .
and my fellow grandfather , seymour papert , believes it too .
by the time , we found that a mutant , a lot longer needed to attach themselves to the <unk> themselves , and when we were removed the gene that mutation in mutation in that mutation , we could discover a <unk> .
it &apos;s been asked for a long time with people , but at fly , we actually can &apos;t test it .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark , by looking us out of us . they smell us .
just to see it , this is the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re being bitten by mosquitos now .
in <unk> trials .
and every time i felt the <unk> look at the face of the eyes of me behind me .
and as <unk> , fat is one of the most promising source for adult stem cells .
so while we &apos;re talking about embryonic trials , studying embryonic stem cells for the testing of stem cells .
we are very happy , because we have the opportunity to have the angels in the world , not only in our country , venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when that doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about that , because i &apos;ve got off the headlines .
<unk> <unk> : what you don &apos;t know about marriage marriage .
but how ?
it turns even better . it turns out we can make these interventions , using material that &apos;s coded by material that &apos;s coded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it turns out , but it can &apos;t really look , because the fly between two fires is trapped .
for a smart nature like our fly , it &apos;s not nailed into stone , but it turns out , as the animal experience learn from experience .
through a lot of these experiments , we were able to get the identity of the critic &apos;s identity from about 12 cells .
so there &apos;s a bunch of ideas in the <unk> and the artificial intelligence of how to do it , but we still haven &apos;t solved one single example , like smart behavior from the physical interactions of the physical interactions of living matter of living matter .
here &apos;s actually a video game , or actually a mechanical field of activity .
ed : all right . well , tb : ok . so a little bit on the inside , i &apos;m going to ask a little bit of the middle .
so from your own experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my legacy from legacy .
one of them , i &apos;ll tell you , these kinds of <unk> , which includes everything from their goals to their genes , becomes the gradual transformation that we will see in our lifetime in public health .
they don &apos;t uncomfortable like velcro or glue or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if they went on to the underside of the mountain , and it would come down a <unk> or we would shake the sheet of tape , or would we shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so they did also <unk> . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course entirely different , when you saw that in a conversational system .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say people who are working in the oceans and think about the goals , we think they should be much lower .
this is the ship that i was at the last three months at antarctica .
when this ice ice ice continues sea ice is melting down at the depths of six meters .
what was the causal cause ?
in both these cases , the bad news for the galapagos islands are islands .
you have a relationship with your temperature .
but then at the end of it , you see the <unk> black box in black .
we have a very interesting view of the co2 co2 emissions in the atmosphere millions of years from the atmosphere , but in this case we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years back .
and this is the task that einstein has asked to do : figure out how gravity works .
now , einstein has already seen space and time , warps and curves used to describe gravity .
but deep in the fabric of space , the idea could exist more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello different , they can actually vibrate that kind of strings can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this interesting mathematical designs that may be able to detect some <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually detect those extra dimensions ?
so , we &apos;ve got two plates with colored plates on it .
now , can you see the predator seeing the predator , what &apos;s the point to attacking them ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for all the information .
and we &apos;re about 30 seconds of what a normal hammer is in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the dark in this shadow would actually reflect the same amount of light on your eye , like the ones on your eye , you would have to reflect more -- simply by laws of physics .
where do you know ?
and she comes into the hive , find an empty <unk> and hands -- and this is honey .
he &apos;ll find him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s no way there is no right or wrong .
in new york , not so much .
we also are also a species of storytellers .
now some of the things : understanding of safety , the risks , the risks , the marshes , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , you need models to see the many risks with which we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , h1n1 , swine flu .
there were no new insights , but fewer fear .
and there &apos;s another inherent bias : i call it <unk> , by which we tend to take the data out of our <unk> and interrogate the data that we don &apos;t disagree with each other .
i &apos;m familiar with another group , to see if my airplane was safely to fly with it .
these people <unk> people .
and he was pictured here with him , at stanford .
they had good positions with their teachers , with students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that is a good choice . &quot;
i was taking on , for anyone to try and rescue them or rescue , where i was able to report myself as a volunteer , but i found that nobody could do something .
we opened up the first part of 2009 in 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups used a very often term called &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need an <unk> process with which the core of these very complex society can deal with his problems .
it &apos;s probably that we &apos;re probably at the first time in the history of the arab world a revolution from the bottom of the arab world a revolution .
the paradox is that the <unk> decade was so promising , and it was a basic reason for a main reason .
at once , the ngos were calling out not only about the streets -- but they took them into negotiations of negotiation , for part , because they took the victims of those weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think <unk> is something good .
so this was completely clear .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new toolbox .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this weird <unk> man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the sun comes out , and the sun comes out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about a radical thing , about how we &apos;re going to talk about cancer differently , a lot of people who know about cancer a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients .
it turns out there &apos;s a big amount of information in genetics , just comparing genetic similarity to look at the genetic similarity .
and i like , &quot; ok . at least this guy &apos;s good . &quot;
so , basically , we basically measure each of these tumors as a creature .
if you have malaria , we give them a discount , or some of the <unk> of it .
where we really have to get through , is the process which is just going on , and on the level of the <unk> activities on the level of the body , the idea of why the body is not himself , how to do it ?
danny hillis : cancer &apos;s understanding
they &apos;re all member of tribes in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give these people up .
because level three is most of us .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before someone tried something like this .
martin luther was martin luther <unk> sentence in stage three .
so i sit there in this chair and doing nothing . &quot;
and all of a sudden they took the <unk> out , and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the people of smallpox ? &quot;
automatically we beam the little bits of plastic up to the top .
these <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , who became designed so much as so much longer to put the taxes on the ground , on which they were facing , were not as permanent buildings .
they <unk> the stability and the safety states of an emergency state , if you can offer them with the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in high school , <unk> <unk> in high school .
but from perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it is the most fundamental form of <unk> gratification .
i can &apos;t really tell them , and he can &apos;t really tell them .
stories like these , signs like these , are practical assistance in a world who are looking at compassion , the hyper-consumption of the suffering that we could not possibly conceive of .
gandhi was also a really scary person .
and for the first day , our <unk> flew us and taught us our importance of what we had to do every day for the rest of the summer .
this is one of those two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group of either pack to <unk> the opinion of the others .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example of my grandfather in my own way .
okay , number two : go into the wilderness .
and so imagine that , you have an inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , but unfortunately , very fierce , and my parents had not suffered higher education .
and so we think through all the changes that what happens is that we face incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s an initiative that is focused on simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
we &apos;ve taken 30 different technologists now , in 18 different countries , and we &apos;ve been able to link millions of people together in the effort to learn what this particular market needs and demands .
and my dad came to me and my dad came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that each generation has to do it better than the previous generation .
i know many people who are very smart , and yet , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i founded them together in 1980 with another family .
do you not believe that we have the responsibility taking serious action ? &quot;
i still have the same four years old as it was .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
if you believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make me any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you hold in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball basketball player , and this basketball player represents your identity , which is what you are .
when my kids were still little , i always went into her room , sat down on her bed , watching my children in the sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i &apos;m involved with three to 10 million -- but yet , it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a small village , we then have 100 laptops , each with a different collection of books , so that the village finally got 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for pedagogy .
they answering the question : what does it feel like to make sure that you feel yourself ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think of a moment of what it is like to feel right now .
and unlike any other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to find it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought , i &apos;m writing this incredibly compelling book about a topic that everybody would hate , for a audience who would never give it .
of course , the effect of this is not just <unk> <unk> wheat , but mounds of grains .
1986 , vietnam from vietnam in vietnam .
and the answer was <unk> : &quot; this is worse worse . &quot;
our <unk> dropped dropped by a third of the business in our business , and in the five years of the dotcom system , our <unk> has dropped tripled .
and bhutan , for those who don &apos;t know , is the recent democracies in the world , just two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we usually prefer in the west , as well as being the lucky thing we have to catch , one thing , one thing , or perhaps some of the things that we have to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- this is the simplicity .
what we really need to learn from leaders is that we can actually change the production force of production by using the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : all right . one , two , three .
under deck says , you &apos;re going to get your <unk> , you &apos;re moving your eyes , and you &apos;re saying , &quot; i stand silent on that boat , and say , &quot; i stand silent . &quot;
amy , would you please ?
the method : what did you do ? what do you saw ?
i &apos;m just trying to do one .
real scientific education is going to give people a voice , and they enable to say to express , so amy the last resort in this short history .
poor people have this choice choice .
we went into the &apos; 70s .
and to go along there , we have to recognize that the principle of a group dynamic not only the species we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society is <unk> .
now , 60 years later , i can tell you why it is possible .
i &apos;m sure , you know , someone asked you , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the caribbean <unk> system , and i got a lot of attention to that , and so that gave me a lot of attention to the beginning of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart , and they end up here .
i mean , people are surely wondering if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , you know , the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> cell phone of his wife .
and for those of you who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it sounds like a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where not <unk> , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t worry about the toxins of toxins in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , <unk> death <unk> .
and months later later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this degrading paper in our hands , we have redefining the hope again again .
but it &apos;s a feature .
all of a sudden he knows that it has been defeated .
to give you this , we need to put it back on the side side .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people into it , we sent the buildings from the inside , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> , in search and rescue .
if i do this , i &apos;m not losing the original details , on the contrary , i could write here .
you &apos;re withheld from public opinion officers .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and what a democracy is about .
here &apos;s the question : what country healthy is better , china or india ?
because the indian man in life expectancy for life expectancy for two years across the indian woman .
in terms of political change , they &apos;ve introduced <unk> .
so , in china , i think there &apos;s still some outstanding , <unk> essentials -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality , which doesn &apos;t exist in india .
it was a place where people with <unk> <unk> and with different <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money on trying to do with these advanced electronics with these advanced electronics in these countries , and now everything is <unk> .
a slightly true environment , where probably many ideas emerged , where people tend to have new ideas , interesting , interesting , people have different origin .
so , about one or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> with the name of howard <unk> , and read darwin &apos;s notebook out out of this period .
they wished for their peers , but everybody said , &quot; no , i haven &apos;t thought about doing it .
do it also goes too much longer ?
in the 1970s , &quot; one percent &quot; 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
so many of these political factors can be put together in the category of &quot; crony capitalism , &quot; which leads a group of mutual commitments , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
so , as you can see , as you can &apos;t see how globalization and technology revolution can create this global sovereignty , it &apos;s much harder to grade .
that &apos;s why they invest unprecedented doses of time and resources to make their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
on one of them , we &apos;re going to die all of them .
so this was a big mistake for us , because we believed in a new development system .
in fact , i think in places like oregon , where you can take care of treatment and try to get out toxic doses , only half percent of people have ever performed .
well , the long talk short , they came to canada .
but i heard from cancer as most of the <unk> illness of our time , and how did we fit the good and the bad thing together ?
some articles went too far to say that fey &apos;s resistant to cancer , and beyond that , not just cancer , but rather than cancer , they were spreading out into skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! meaning there were those tumors in skeletal muscle in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what controls skeletal muscle might be able to control the angiogenesis vessels , can be able to control the tumors that these blood vessels are able to recover .
this is a very reactive idea , but i really think it &apos;s possible .
afterwards , my translator resigned .
she was the girl who <unk> the other for her team .
and i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had one of the 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so , the two came from lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all korea in korea , and he found families for her .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open this window out , look out , and see how burned from the side of the box fires up into the sky . hotel burns .
and so we walked into the bath , took obsolete , and they took it from our faces and the kids .
until the adoption is through . one year ! what does that mean ?
this is her <unk> .
this is a lawyer that will be three-year-old in a few days old days .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s little planet ; there &apos;s bigger planets ; there are big planets , ok .
but there are still a lot more to do .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon is ubiquitous , or is it something that is dependent upon on any planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , which is the essence of it , is that the science of how we know it is to redefine it .
so , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all these stars , ok , from here to there .
thank you very much .
you see , whereas zimbabwe <unk> and zimbabwe <unk> , russia moves on one percent .
they find the highest hiv guess in the world in african countries , and yet they find senegal , the same rate as in the united states .
look at this kenya here .
it might be something different , which is why the transmission is common .
we know that about <unk> billion people have lived since .
that wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even more radical divergence in a shorter span of time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s also with institutions .
you only have to give me to consume . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions of the future billion in 2016 , when the united states loses its place as a number of an economy in china .
no , we &apos;re going to <unk> , regardless of the enormous <unk> we have , regardless of the evidence that we have lost our ethic of our work ethic and other parts of our historical minds .
niall , thank you .
there are lots of spider spider silks .
spider silk is almost entirely out of dragline silk .
the fibers that can create a single spider are quite diverse .
also , <unk> have a very strong potential because of your ability to <unk> .
what i want to focus on is not the <unk> , which is so lovely , but it &apos;s on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
it sounds strange in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of reviewers have done a lot of effort .
the first thing is , if you look at a problem , the first goal of the institution is that the first goal is to change the institution immediately .
the creators don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it &apos;s been done by analyzing a lot of these tools , the use of a lot of these tools , at least , but no doubt , the intelligence agency of the world today are doing the same work on the attacks of the week .
you have <unk> , which is probably the most likely part of bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just forming fibers , because there &apos;s a lot of fibers , because there &apos;s a lot of fibers .
everything is in its place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps again , under the <unk> of the possible level of view -- my search for the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they &apos;re going to go back to see that they &apos;re going to come up and develop the character .
if they make this bread , they can use every kind of spent spent of every beer .
it &apos;s going to be kind of <unk> while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes a very , very long time writing those scores , and at the time i &apos;m working on a piece that is worth the hundred pages of my life , which is a big part of my life , and i &apos;m sending myself the hair .
it &apos;s done by brian <unk> who is an amazing artist .
so that gives you a little bit of a little <unk> of the show .
what we did — betty <unk> , one of my graduate students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food , a bowl of broccoli .
i mean , at the end of all , when we look at babies at the face , they &apos;re quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
and the <unk> takes you to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : this .
so our minds of this thing becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will become dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the <unk> of the human species , says the <unk> alison <unk> . they study their research as babies during the game , and they make decisions .
now , if i could look for a little bit short for a little demo , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually kind of a trivial thing .
then again , you repeat this process and again and again until something comes out -- in this case , it &apos;s supposed to be the shape , like me , walk straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
so you can &apos;t do that .
there &apos;s a couple of simple scenes that he &apos;s going to come out of .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it anyway .
some studios now use our software to do that , and we will soon begin to see some of our minds in a bunch of big <unk> .
we thought that it would only hold only the balance .
here you learn to go on to <unk> -- as most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m sure that art and creativity are critical for creating empathy .
if you &apos;re ever going to write , write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails .
but some stories are just old , but some of them are kind of evaporating .
it <unk> . no one has ever bought it .
there &apos;s a line that we don &apos;t want . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft neutral , ok . if you want to create a new blank document in word -- it could be !
but i think there are actually two main cycles that actually exist .
the other products were inspired by microsoft with an open standard , <unk> , instead of <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , if someone sends me a letter to me -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; bobbing &quot; slow me . &quot;
but as i looked at the disruptive technology , remarkably , <unk> and others in the world , <unk> digital technologies , i made myself very big worried about the interior .
and to cut up the problem of those new things , we eventually have to limit the ability of individuals , which gives them access to <unk> power .
i think the challenge we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is that we &apos;re going to develop those <unk> using the background that we get from this device to benefit from us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , like <unk> , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties of incredible properties .
and so , to give you an perspective of the last number of small company -- it turns out to be 400 million bucks , which is pretty substantial for us now .
and if you think about the concept of transnational , you can create a lot of practical entity , the entity of the market -- use to deliver feedback .
twelve years ago , caves began to <unk> me , and i shifted my research on this direction .
so , wonderful and dark things .
there &apos;s ice caps on the surface there .
so they &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave , that there is actually a big number of energy in this cave .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have been a lot of characteristics among people from people and other organisms than they used for habitat use .
whenever you put a goal together , you have to take some additional steps out there , pushing up some chance on yourself .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
fakes were taken over there , and it was reviewed by extreme scientists .
so before we start able to begin to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart from the book .
and this looks like this .
but by rotating the electrons fly around with the speed of light , they give you x-rays .
it was a bad idea because <unk> <unk> had a son named <unk> of the big , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , institutions had <unk> their data with <unk> and whatnot .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most successful <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
i wondered : 160 bucks for what ?
she has four main balcony .
a <unk> scheme is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet toilet .
there was a object i couldn &apos;t get into the hand , and it was the <unk> chateau <unk> .
and i don &apos;t have -- call my taste for me -- call my taste -- so it wasn &apos;t necessarily important that i was not impressed , but i was not the only one in there , with that response .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual skins of it was sold for <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting about virtuality is that you can measure them .
now , i could develop a game with the name <unk> by just trying to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do a lot , but in one game we say , &quot; ok , then . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is in it .
and i would like to tell you a short story in 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it can be changed how personalized engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we watch people play in play .
it &apos;s a kind of time-lapse computer scientist who &apos;s been interrogated by <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m really obsessed with food .
there is certainly hunger in america , 49 million people , and almost <unk> million children and nearly <unk> million children .
and their farms are too large .
it &apos;s the 30th anniversary of corn grains and the big <unk> , from chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change of the way we have agriculture internationally .
this is a <unk> i got two years ago . that was one of the largest projects i and my company and the company were ever involved in .
but i &apos;m going to limit myself on the beginning of the process , three very basic statements .
so , if we &apos;re so good at what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that would fit perfectly well through the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
the architectural practice was , <unk> said , simple .
and this is the actual reward effort .
the second technology we used to use , we use things we use from the radio waves of opera .
here you see the <unk> low configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you collect stories in something practical .
one of those projects is about an hour and a half .
these are the images that automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the throat .
you can see a timeline timeline showing you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , on .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if they found a year for only one year , what would they do for the next 35 years ?
&quot; money deserve , and business was opening up , &quot; was the indian <unk> .
during the day of she , he had told them that he had been doing , and he had given me some of a long-term chance of survival .
don &apos;t you get me wrong , writing has benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , unless in <unk> , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if what lol does it means .
you don &apos;t do that .
if anyone had seen from 1973 on a black newspaper , the <unk> would have been a little bit different since the time from &apos; &quot; love &quot; , &quot; but he would have understood what it was there .
i &apos;m about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you &apos;re going to look at my work next week , and in fact , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
afghanistan does not represent an existential risk of global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a standard <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats development in <unk> .
and eventually , we have to understand that the secret from what we moved in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success , was to be part of our ultimate success in the gentle part of our <unk> .
rory , and i mentioned libya to end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system on a finger to show you directly what it looks like .
there are also <unk> who are going to be <unk> , but if they &apos;re using these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re used for a different type of gamma input .
the <unk> . it &apos;s a difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting bond here , and this is what you want to do , is that what you want to do is take advantage of ownership information on a generic basis of a common thing .
so , i think it &apos;s the kind of regional food that we can probably possibly get to make things .
and we decided we shouldn &apos;t really think about it in terms of cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book , which is called , &quot; what &apos;s going on with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who are not like themselves .
so , we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half , when i say , they will not believe in the hospital when they come with a missing hit , no previous <unk> , mri and <unk> <unk> .
then bell begins bell of his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , finally , became a diagnosis of the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis , the <unk> <unk> .
between the patient &apos;s perception and the patient &apos;s perception , in terms of the patient health care , there &apos;s a real contradiction .
also another experience i did in texas , and before i went to stanford , i felt myself .
the bad news is that we don &apos;t know the results . look at it ? you can do it , we can do it , we can do it . &quot;
i remember so many big , <unk> , <unk> eyes , and that &apos;s kind of <unk> in this ritual to me .
some of them refer to us , some of them call us a rather peaceful term .
in this case we have the review .
for you , there is , &quot; then a wonder !
and there was no way too <unk> .
religious <unk> .
it &apos;s harder to move the dead into an answer .
my friend simon singh , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang . &quot; etc .
and now , you open your eyes .
you can completely open it up , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it actually suggested to me that these guys , at least , know these guys , at least , know what they do for their living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can generate lots of change in change . you can build streets .
and this is something that people want to aspire to .
you don &apos;t need anybody .
hugo <unk> has invented the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in venezuela . he has them only performed .
and that &apos;s always going on .
they connect people together .
the reason that we can use modern medicine is a 60 years old way .
there &apos;s still a catch .
this makes it faster , over 3,000 times , over 3,000 times less , and over 400 times more than our current <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with the world in the world is very different .
so , there is the character of the character .
and why does they take sex into babies , and why does babies mean an erotic disaster ?
because there &apos;s the secret of the <unk> .
so importantly , it &apos;s very important about this description of the other or my own -- that &apos;s the same thing -- especially interesting is that there are no <unk> in desire .
this is their <unk> and <unk> , this is biology , natural instinct .
and then this starts desire . this is what fascinating curiosity , <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s a erotic room at all .
other places in the country had similar rooms .
in a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s played mostly in smaller spaces .
so early detection , some of these are plausible <unk> .
so i asked myself : ok , that &apos;s a model for creation , these <unk> that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and he said , &quot; i mean there &apos;s me !
so how do we solve these three problems that i want to bring here to speech ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m talking about someone when i was at princeton a speech , and there i met mr. einstein .
what about life ? why am i here ?
i never finish a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian <unk> said two centuries later , &quot; he said a very powerful spirit with the authority of jesus christ &apos; authority of jesus christ . &quot;
he was what he was designing for him .
i &apos;m not going to go beyond the <unk> <unk> .
but for that , you have to sit down about 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that is not there .
i never had been pure .
harvest <unk> .
with tears in the eyes i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman is standing in president <unk> , and he says her and her brothers , her parents died in war .
we go into <unk> areas , and everything we do is what we &apos;re doing in this room , we &apos;re creating a room .
i have failed .
i want to look back at 20 years now and see that there &apos;s a teenage girl , a girl named <unk> , <unk> girls on this ted stage .
lg : to happen .
licklider intuitively realized , computers can do the necessary things to make insights into insights and decisions .
each interaction is recorded from increasingly more sensors : your phone , your credit , your computers , your computers , are a lot of data , and we get the opportunity to understand our presence .
these records were human rights .
by joining a <unk> process , which has a job for 40 people about three months , became a simple task for three people in 40 different hours , and all these are <unk> <unk> .
we should stop looking at it .
for dinner with my wife and riding home with my wife .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have a time fit ; you want to be fit .
she became a much larger dog than i thought .
these affect us affect everyone .
and the boom of the legal system is <unk> up to our problems .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the age of katrina we have more mature in the age of katrina .
and you &apos;ve probably all done that , and if you don &apos;t have it , you will .
help me help me make green to new light , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mom .
but i &apos;m a bit skeptical about what these <unk> are .
in this case , you put a pile of wood , put it on one pile and put it on a pile of different characters in a game or a story , in this case , this is the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can learn to learn from code .
when kids like footprints like magnets , they learn a lot of important concepts like variables , but it &apos;s only the beginning .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today , to give you a context , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this idea is that great cars is a soul , very useful , and you all know , you know , you &apos;re looking at a car with your head at your first sight . you know how powerful it is .
this is one of my favorite subjects that really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided it would be cheaper instead of a millisecond and six or seven <unk> of elizabeth <unk> in malibu in malibu in malibu in malibu .
there was lots of dialogue .
so , i think we felt very close to each other of this day , which we ended up with , and we commented the idea for the real nature of true quantum creativity and creativity .
we didn &apos;t get it to boston .
so , because i just have a little lab .
by now , we &apos;ve been clinical trials in four main elements of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that we can &apos;t get this medicines under the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to think is that we have to do it with a hundred billion galaxies with a hundred billion galaxies , with the top 100 billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was , why the entropy corps had ever been low .
in contrast , in the early entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer , we have at least a good theory , which is true , and that theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe lasts forever and ordinary matter and radiation becomes <unk> , there will always be a certain amount of radiation to radiation , some thermal fluctuations of radiation , even in empty space .
but we also have a big fluctuations too .
it cools down .
it &apos;s a fundamental fact of the universe that you accept and not question .
i had never used computers yet .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to go out there , like me , say to the africans and the poor people with their dreams .
no matter what movements i did in my real world was just explained by my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in the year 2000 .
i took this really literally , i took my snorkel , and i sat down a little bit of <unk> , which <unk> a trivial thing .
interestingly , the camera , obviously , not only my movements , but is also able to make sense of understanding what things i hold in my hand .
and why is just <unk> ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is learn from my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june june this june .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep down below the earth to build a nuclear station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
and almost every year we have these terrible <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re below the average of the <unk> in the city .
a city of the future is a city , which is not dependent on this great community , which are towns .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwin <unk> <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make them beautiful , so they create a kind of attraction , so they &apos;re looking for joy , just to look at them .
and some of them are too large in every case to use them on battles .
our strong response on images , the expression of feelings in art , to beauty from music in front of us and our offspring as it exists for us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
now , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can use it .
so , you can see here what the computer is seeing the environment , and as you can &apos;t see the vibrating , we &apos;re going to end the driver even with red leds , so he can actually see what &apos;s going on .
see if mark can harvest them .
or for the blind people in the household in the household , in <unk> , in the office and in the office .
more subtle <unk> started , the <unk> , that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices , and i knew them , meant that something related to me was not able to vote with me .
my objected was a catalyst for <unk> , called <unk> and physical <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , they would be better off because cancer is easier to cure than schizophrenia . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> , if the social change starts , he cannot be more repressive .
and this is what we currently go through .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that we should look for life , rather than on mars , but obviously mars is a very much more exciting and more interesting place .
and the usual bird was full of disdain about it .
because it can <unk> the way that life can live there , there &apos;s tremendous benefits compared with life on a planet .
there was another object , this tall <unk> furniture , with creatures and <unk> and blank -- pretty heavy stuff for a little kid .
the first projects they did , but they took technology , and they took technology , and they might be able to find things that people use in a new way , and perhaps a new functionality .
so the other thing , the <unk> thing , is that we decided , all the gadgets , <unk> <unk> , all of these things , and trying to make it as lifelike as possible .
so , we call it y gaga . so this is another example where everything happens in a room : this three-dimensional design , the ideas , the ideas , the brand , it &apos;s everything deeply interconnected .
this is my favorite anthony , switzerland , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to return him back again . it was hard .
yves behar : the designs of objects , the stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> and brilliant wife , became an early widow .
she was the <unk> <unk> of rights , which i &apos;ve ever heard of .
look at these young girls who went back to school after sulfuric acid into their face . &quot;
the world that was given in layma was a world in war .
then , the situation will be tense .
they must negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , which are growing in a world where everything is knowable , and some of our best conversations on the screen have occurred on the screen .
finally , it might mean that they could print your own medicine .
and if you ask about why it &apos;s interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because there &apos;s a country that &apos;s divided by saudi arabia .
perhaps some things are bad traditions , and they need changes .
so let me give you an example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very aggressive republic , until recently something i call <unk> , which is to protect the universities , against <unk> students .
now if i &apos;d be the only person that thinks , then we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims saw europe as example , they were independent , <unk> .
and therefore , the e.u. became , the efforts of turkey , the legitimacy of turkey , the e.u. , within turkey by the pious countries , whereas some <unk> nations were against them .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be seen as if they were linked to anything that would be connected with anything .
if scientists today , a century later , they want to make neurons visible , and they &apos;re light up from the inside , instead of creating it .
carl <unk> : glimpses inside our brain
but that trend is less clear .
but for many parts of africa , it &apos;s a colleague of mine , saying , &quot; the truce on the tuesday was right at the right time , so that the genocide could begin at the center of the <unk> . &quot;
and instead of taking this opportunity , local leaders and international leaders are moved soon and they have moved themselves from the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> . in 2001 , and the wars in iraq and iraq .
<unk> design takes a strong focus on the <unk> , thinking , thinking and <unk> and <unk> .
stromatolites are the hero of my story .
in flat oceans , life appeared on a bit earlier ; it turned out to be more complex shapes .
<unk> moved across continents . these big migrations started .
and some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have a luxury of luxury .
but there were nothing for that purpose , so we have <unk> with prostate cancer , and then we created our slogan , which is , &quot; the face of men &apos;s health change . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and from britain <unk> us and calling us , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year , we were lucky enough to have 450,000 <unk> . &quot;
that kind of entertainment , men involved in it , in every age , is critical and important , and i think so much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what his forest was seeing , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> than he was two years old , and he started to teach him the life of his people .
when i think about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our fingertips would , when they ask themselves the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human health .
she operates with people like <unk> krishna .
for a lifetime , through all of the cultural revolution , everything came from the cultural revolution , collected it , so it collected over eight million parts in its museum today , documenting contemporary chinese history .
it &apos;s just happening .
&quot; my world is subjective .
or perhaps , he was just a concept that was just sitting on a floating ball and the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you have an extraordinary life of life , you will get into the <unk> , or , as the french call it , the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- -- the skies of <unk> .
and so , it comes up with these great rituals that build up large <unk> of <unk> and for 10 days .
do you see , what is business as a result of the behavior of the market and the behavior of an organization ?
you see , this is india today . the <unk> of reality is based on a <unk> christian view .
you know , he &apos;s created the largest oil company , called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i chosen this path , why don &apos;t i get interested , just get me . &quot;
<unk> <unk> opens up the eyes of a new view on the myth of india and the west -- and reveals why these <unk> systems of the <unk> system , the <unk> of death and the <unk> help us help us contextualize ourselves together .
but , you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world says , &quot; i am totally competent , &quot; which is , &quot; i am totally competent , &quot; which is to defend yourself with the toughest praise .
your interests is compared to what ?
your friends and family will get together at the <unk> cemetery and there , on her grave being a tombstone on that is said , &quot; welcome here a great engineer , who invented velcro theory . &quot;
they &apos;re thrilled . this is the conversation and dads , because your child is good in math , and you know what comes next .
that &apos;s because they know what they are . they know what they are .
i have no patents , and i &apos;ve never secured money from a medical service company , and i don &apos;t think you &apos;re choose to choose .
so where do you know if your breast is from high density levels ?
ultrasound has more biopsies to follow , which are worse than other technologies , and it &apos;s not very widespread .
if you find a tumor , as long as it is less than one centimeter , the average rate is about 90 percent , but it falls more with a total amount of increase .
the picture of the mbi shows a lot more explicit in the same way as a second tumor , which is slowed down a lot on the surgical possibilities of the patient .
it costs a radiologists in particular training , to get an expert in it , to be able to distinguish a regular <unk> detail from a priesthood .
some of those women who get breast cancer are dying many years later , and luckily , most of them survive .
and there &apos;s <unk> da vinci da vinci da dum da vinci da vinci da vinci da vinci because there &apos;s a lot of power there .
we gather those physicists into los angeles to see what they build .
mill mill .
they &apos;ve slept in this wild hospital .
this is a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s come to the point .
what did i do ? have i listened to my gut ?
that &apos;s interesting . this is another way to think .
the <unk> is basically a visualizing of a human being , where every bit of bit is the steepest in the brain that is engaged in the brain .
this is white noise .
and <unk> is probably going to go into your direction .
i did that only to make money .
thank you .
and he said to me after a long silence : &quot; i ask myself , &quot; if people don &apos;t find their benches more fascinating than my videos . &quot;
this is the reason i with david edward , a scientist from harvard , creating an object that is able to absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
and the tragedy of other people &apos;s tragedies can take easier than your own , and i want to go to the <unk> spirit of this conference .
on malcolm gladwell was &#91; the &#93; <unk> &#93; , the <unk> version of <unk> <unk> for the inner city .
he was a really interesting looking at it .
he went back into the second floor and said , &quot; hey guys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
and let &apos;s think about the comparison of other animals , where you can &apos;t expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was working on marketing and cheating .
economists talk about the game theory -- that every game for two people has a video projector .
<unk> is skydiving with one board at the feet .
so , as high as it is as high as it is to be able to step step forward , if you &apos;re working on step drawing , if you &apos;re working really hard and work on yourself .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally , i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that by putting some natural elements on some natural elements , a little bit of haze , i was able to tangibilitate the space .
<unk> : it makes a difference if you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance is moving smaller .
how do we create an idea which is to take both tolerance to individuality and to <unk> directions without two different directions ?
i was talking about new forms of agriculture , one , these animals , instead of <unk> them .
but even more importantly , the material was what the <unk> were taken .
take from the dead and take it off from the dead .
at that time , he taught the considerable at the <unk> college in <unk> college .
natalie jeremijenko sings old poem poems about life .
<unk> <unk> , when a dolphin gets hardly .
as an adult , when i think about the amazing eruptions of penny and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and europe , <unk> <unk> , and alex , the <unk> , the <unk> , i was talking about it .
<unk> <unk> : ng : like there .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re paying for the outstanding anesthesia , for our research and sustaining .
we saw quite rapidly realizing that we had created a system that connects people together .
now , this is the first time you &apos;re talking about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter on who we hold a israel flag .
&quot; because it works , does a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , and i remember that <unk> talk to a journalist and said , &quot; who is going to see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the <unk> . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is <unk> , and sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can &apos;t prevent it .
and what we aspire to do with is more radical is more , to try to make sure that the architectural manifestations will be defined almost as a matter of who or what we are .
and we saw this dude , <unk> .
and slowly starting to think that sustainable life is less fun than living normal lives .
so , if you go to the expo , first of all , the danish cycle of cycle , bringing yourself into a windowless wheel , etc .
it was interesting because it was interesting , because they present nine to eleven about the <unk> in the morning . how many billion they should invest in the economy .
this is a <unk> from switzerland switzerland switzerland on switzerland , there &apos;s a national budget on <unk> <unk> .
we often do small films often small films .
what i &apos;d like to talk about , which is the largest problems in the world .
but , of course , it &apos;s a problem when people challenging people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m looking at is really to say , for a very long period of time , we have a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choice .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little cost , very expensive cost .
and the <unk> of malaria is <unk> on a number of millions per year .
what &apos;s going on here is we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a great movie about what i want to see him for sure is true , but you don &apos;t expect from <unk> in his next movie to <unk> brad in the next movie in tanzania or something like that .
they had all of the same stuff , but they were able to rely on the basis of the discussion , and they definitely made it to their own lists .
his power , wealth and greater freedom , is <unk> . &quot;
secondly , china has done it to dramatically reduce the quality of income distribution without changing the political framework .
but <unk> house found that , although 50 percent of all countries are democratic , 70 percent of them are oppressive percent of them , in terms of ensuring people don &apos;t have <unk> or <unk> .
because then , finally , the question is , is the question that we and seven billion other people on this planet is : how can we create wealth ?
the <unk> isn &apos;t really on your place .
we &apos;re going to get what we really care about .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s got incredible attention in germany .
you have to make one for the growth optimal temperature .
i think it looks light to a human skin from what i &apos;m fascinated .
but i think it might be a rather <unk> and sustainable supplement into our organizational society .
chinese workers are not squeezed into factories because of our domestic demand for ipods .
only because one of them is spending their time trying to create a piece of something , doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s going to become a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some of you understand that . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the <unk> , and the min on my parents &apos; homeland was in the train .
the taliban run your own schools .
when any child hits it will break off those rules , it gets hard to break it off .
if i look at my suicide bombers , they &apos;re younger than me , or at my age , i feel so inspired by their <unk> .
and this is going to go on there , on enceladus , on enceladus , to enceladus , which is obviously obtained in the middle of the middle future , especially equipped to pursue that question .
is the internet actually a place you can visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started looking at it , there was only a cable on the african west coast , representing here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .
and that doesn &apos;t really get me right .
this is sent layer by layer on the device , starting with the base of the product , starting from the product of the product , and puts out the material layer by layer into a <unk> process .
it was designed by layers of layers from layers about four <unk> .
a repulsion gets less likely .
they can just make it straight right in front of place .
here will be the product .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology can create a revolution in manufacturing and <unk> how we think it will transform .
he was worried that when he called it in this name , especially out , in the public , you could think he &apos;d come out of jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .
but a lot of those factors that played a role game is actually even stronger . half work is done .
i was with my friend susan <unk> , the <unk> , in the aristotelian valley in the hebrew valley .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty wasn &apos;t the reaction . it was the undermine and the embarrassment of the whole thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to violence the violence or the drugs ? lack of privacy ?
first of all , instead of going through the end of months and forget , the time was a lot more <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely that they remain .
and during my first year i performed my company further .
it turns out more energy is needed to make a solar cell than it will grow in its entire chain .
solar panels , but it &apos;s shining for four and a half hour long .
they also stand under big pressure , and therefore dangerous is dangerous .
this is a moose .
there &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the <unk> in it , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder is at the upper end -- that part is cold , that &apos;s cold , and out there comes electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , but it can cool .
so here we have a map of united states .
and we don &apos;t have a throwaway energy system trying to use energy as quickly as we do it at the moment .
we pour it on and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab in which we did the tectonic lab in the field of this molecule .
but i &apos;d continue to write bad things , and he &apos;s never written the air pump into the air , but he &apos;s gone into cuba .
so , from <unk> , great things can happen -- -- by which i then draw a picture of , which will end in my work , which is going to end up in my work .
i &apos;m working on the new yorker , and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then 9 / 11 , and it was , like , a <unk> end of the world as we knew it .
and then he says , &quot; chop yourself clear . &quot; is it <unk> with your tongue , but it &apos;s like we understand it . &quot;
and he said , &quot; and he decided that his <unk> needed to be extinct . &quot;
this guy &apos;s mad , because someone sits around his staircase <unk> <unk> , and basically -- you know , <unk> seem to be a theme here .
and it &apos;s kind of like george <unk> out there , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my most recent days , and after that , i had assigned myself many different demonstrations , and when i was young , it always occurred to me that my way was <unk> .
this is beautiful , but we should also remind ourselves that a similar process should also focus on inner level .
td : lakshmi had worked incredibly hard , even to my invitation , even to my invitation , even from everything else they &apos;ve done , so i &apos;ve been quite resistant to this , and i was quite resistant during this entire week , and i was also very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in simulating , and others that have learned in the actual language .
when i say , &quot; i mean , i mean the advice of <unk> .
but nobody thinks it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there is a real outbreak .
the largest part of the u.k. spending in bush is actually more related to everything else and the danger of <unk> .
we know that the virus will be squeezed . it &apos;s going to be another virus .
but in the academic community , there &apos;s a raging debate about what percentage of the difference between people are through <unk> and coughing , and there &apos;s how much about their hands .
some of the poorer countries that have most experience with h5n1 have brought up with h5n1 from those who are already <unk> .
and i think even our leaders would say , in this case , we &apos;re still saying a lot to do .
i &apos;m excited to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have developed one of them -- as fast as fast <unk> .
and in the other <unk> people , with people , similar bacterial infections were also not a problem .
don &apos;t just pay for how much fun you have to do with it , but how your <unk> <unk> completely changed the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please join me with me a <unk> .
i presume myself with a young juggler from a company , and he <unk> himself to sell me three clubs .
since my childhood , i started playing with <unk> and climb , so the case is toast . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to become a <unk> .
manhattan don &apos;t get more into the infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m going to stay in the middle .
she became one , drive me to the triumph .
because of the <unk> petals and branches , it &apos;s very dark with the <unk> and very quietly .
and i , my colleagues , of course , are very interested in the dynamic of the proton chain that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advised with the media revolution ; we have a cookout ; we have offline meetings .
and then the students come in our <unk> team , and they took their own <unk> tomato sauce with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn from being able to grow the frog <unk> , which is a huge endangered region of the united states in the state washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look , what you hidden in front of you . &quot;
this is why we see a rising demand for carbon emissions , and therefore , this is why we see a rising demand of demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you must believe me . trust me . &quot;
from that day , i learned two really important things about this day .
the deeper we below water , the higher pressure is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
when the breath goes out into the air atmosphere , air goes out , air comes out of the air floor .
so each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are <unk> , there are still more reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always moving over a lot of miles .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people are represented them .
when we discovered it , we weren &apos;t even sure about what family used to be heard of , so we called him &quot; <unk> , &quot; to the <unk> , because it looked like it was coming from one of his books .
oxygen toxicity had a oxygen processor , and it cuts off .
this means that every one and every one of them knows at least a child who &apos;s suffering from a developmental disorder .
and his communications and social interactions , so <unk> , that he could visit a normal school and became a full-time school .
it &apos;s kind of like life : once you &apos;re in it , you cannot algorithmically again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of samuel pierpont langley , but tell you this day , one day you &apos;ll hear it , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he has died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we , all of us , is what happens when a carbon hydrogen sulfide comes from hydrogen sulfide and helium as long as it starts to wonder about their sources .
these <unk> prove that life can exist in many different environments .
so you have to learn from the diversity and the incredible measure of life on this planet in the first step of life in terms of life elsewhere in it .
so this becomes very important as aluminum as aluminum , and we &apos;ll expand it in the future , by 350 antennas , so it &apos;s sensitive to the moore &apos;s law and to offset moore &apos;s moore &apos;s reproductive legislation .
and then we would like to try to encourage the <unk> search of human rights experience .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to look at the development of climate change .
and every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
as they tacked into the ice , they beam an extra pair of gloves in an oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves in one oven , and your fingers are stiff .
i think there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> at that point .
and what we &apos;re looking at is not just about being able to <unk> from pipelines to <unk> , when they &apos;re actually going to go into the service for the american <unk> .
you can take that further , and the efficiency almost triple with some of the improvements in terms of cost , and therefore double the cost of the big economy .
we could build bigger cars , which would certainly contribute to safety , but we could be easily them .
but instead , they sell it to china , and japan , because we &apos;ve cracked for protection of our <unk> , and the others don &apos;t .
and by specifying the step of mass mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , made <unk> <unk> , as good <unk> , as good predators ; the <unk> can create the same way back then to the internet .
it cannot act like a giant <unk> conspiracy .
there were two kinds of negative feedback that we have conserved .
hope that it &apos;s really really consolidated .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
by the end , he found a <unk> dynasty , a dutch <unk> named han van meegeren , who sold a wonderful vermeer for about 10 million dollars today .
based on his <unk> , he looked like he had discovered for the first time he had discovered that there were bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it matters . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive they find how they make it very sexually or romantic , depending on what they think they &apos;re looking at , depending on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value beyond what it takes to its own , because of his history .
but i don &apos;t want copy , even though i can &apos;t tell the difference .
so joshua bell took joshua bell to go into a subway station in d.c. , on a subway and see how much money he was going to take .
the second shock hurts less , because you get a little bit used to it .
and if you zoom in , you can see that there might be some kind of a kind of political <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> that she &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous and very exciting .
and what you find out , of course , is that people eat the vegetables and olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> conclusion , when you &apos;re a drug in such a high dose , that it turns out there will be more side effects , and your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem where we currently don &apos;t have a solution .
and very soon they would have started , these coal <unk> , 2,000 around 2,000 , <unk> around <unk> , back to china , to china , back to china and anywhere in the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my mind ?
it &apos;s only about oil ; you know , everybody knows that .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and this is right from the united states in the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
dude , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; aha , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they generalize . it &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everyone is chinese .
so , you can imagine that perhaps one of them in the morning &apos;s morning to come down with his kid and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;ll come back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and this has a huge impact on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did it really well in words .
so , for the <unk> in the audience , in fact , why have a bigger budget have a bigger budget than <unk> , because it comes from being translated into other languages and cultures . so the market for those movies is larger .
but it will happen in this century .
this is not the <unk> of the usa , which is about a million , but it &apos;s gdp per capita per capita -- 200 dollars .
also , like everyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is to highlight a lifetime of a lifetime that started growing up with the gulf coast .
a lot of our actions on this planet that engages on our living environment are just driven by faith and guess what motivates them .
one has been replicated for thousands of millions of years of years .
we have to slow ourselves down before we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : saving life on earth
another re-greening example is the famous european <unk> .
the passenger pigeon coated contains 1.3 billion targets .
the de-extinction &apos;s falling fall fall into this category .
real falcon from slightly <unk> chicken .
and behind this is a program for <unk> , which is just a brilliant thing .
this is an emotional topic . some people got up .
my grandmother was a stay-at-home mom .
i also did my own comic book , which was another way to tell stories , by words and through pictures .
and we sat there in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw not as you say it .
&quot; rather jarrett krosoczka , i &apos;ve got your phantom chain .
i &apos;m also going to publish a book of titles with the titles , &quot; <unk> police <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us constantly , psychologically , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a <unk> million pounds ago , major <unk> , which was built recently in britain , created by a u.k. <unk> .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by this .
people who say , don &apos;t let the team sit beside that team because they like the noise and the other silence .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary businessman in his life , which is associated in suitcase with himself , and the idea between the dream and reality is not able to fit both of them .
<unk> <unk> and a half years later , and business later became what began as a <unk> member of foreign actors .
i know theater connects us to us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a smart , playful and extraordinary work .
if you look around in the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some of the products , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also <unk> .
<unk> collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , soy from pigs -- use it to fold it in the <unk> .
in total , i &apos;ve found 185 products now .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid , you have a long and <unk> year front of you . &quot;
i told them , you should try this in front of yourself : &quot; i am somebody .
they gave me a sense of being someone , in a time , where i felt a nobody felt .
they &apos;re just working on ninth output , so they launched it in 1930 and now reached the letter p .
so hundreds of verbs can behave .
you can think of it as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are you being polite , <unk> requests , <unk> and <unk> so often ?
you can try to imagine what it would be if speech could only be used literally literally .
and the other thing is , i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . it &apos;s sustainable ? is it good ?
this makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
so , what have you won , you &apos;ve got to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine an argument where they &apos;re participating in the audience , watching yourself in the audience watching ?
or -- and this is the most important part for me : we want them to be <unk> into the world of nature , and we create a <unk> and find the master of the adaptations in nature that might inspire us .
that changed everything . from there , these were these kinds of engineers were not getting into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national lab .
this would be <unk> for fuel cells , if they could be out without rescue .
this is not simply because life is just using a subset of those elements in <unk> .
and responding and responding : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see , you cannot count .
my first business was a media company . i started walking below the taliban .
in south asia and indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , like by the <unk> , smaller <unk> are tilted towards <unk> economic <unk> .
and the ones in the world are no exceptions .
people were clinging to see if these deletions and this wonder .
i have a tennis court scan of gadget , <unk> himself , <unk> cows on my <unk> dome , and now i want to use paper now to use it .
we first got it off .
what does this mean ?
when i started to look at them with them , i realized that they have adapted incredibly adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
eventually , until they graduated from college and went on the campus -- and surely they were happy to get there out there -- and some of them later came back and discovered that the crows were still reminded of them .
and what we &apos;ve found is that they &apos;re really smart , and they can teach each other things .
migrating , for example , would come back to the peanut , look for the peanut .
but there were three issues , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i &apos;d like to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a nuclear weapon .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and guess what could happen , because every one has something , because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connections .
you know that there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand it .
that &apos;s much too utilitarian .
oh , i &apos;m going to talk about johnny <unk> &apos;s notes .
there &apos;s about 10 million <unk> each about 10 million days .
and what we see over here , by the words of radiologists in israel , &quot; as the hand hits the penis in some way , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would prefer to finish if you didn &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book , which was supposedly <unk> from the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , who had trouble with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read them , what they said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think it &apos;s very unfortunate . it &apos;s not because i want him . i wanted to see him .
and this is actually the beginning of our story .
now , at the time , i would have thought about 50 , one of the skills of 50 , one of the skills that i really needed was to tie my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to lift the different colors .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think it &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have something fun , and before i left the room , i usually buried a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all right there .
my dad was one , so my youth was really interesting .
this song as a purely fact .
i mean , &quot; wait a minute well , i &apos;m going to memorize the wheels . &quot; from undisturbed protest i bought the flashy wheels , and i built them up and -- do you look at them . i might have my phantom fingers ?
it sounds simple , but i think we have a belief in our society and culture <unk> .
he designed the <unk> himself , and he was really quite proud of it .
person , i love this thing .
the effects of a planet on which already seven billion people are living in life .
importantly , he was very proud of the <unk> , the actual seat that he &apos;d lent his comic book for his tennis ball , and on the nice <unk> around around the seat .
intent -- a life of intent -- being aware of the original value thing .
i saw the healthy mass of the left <unk> , and i realized she was lost , <unk> all of what i hadn &apos;t done yet , but it was no longer possible .
then i started looking at how many times many times before , if that man hadn &apos;t been injured , if that man hadn &apos;t injured me , if my genes had a different portion of experience .
i was , but i was , but i was in spite of a pottery i myself and , so i guess myself now , made me myself .
i &apos;d been hoping for something rather humble : this turkish <unk> <unk> for four words , and i put myself back on my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine <unk> laboratory at universities of california , san diego .
one , the notion of human beings , and second , a natural interface , a natural shape of the control , so that the interaction with the robots will be intuitive for them .
and yet , i went to embrace this idea .
after i recognized that economic threat , i thought we must find a solution to this problem .
some of them actually refer to the speakers like to talk about nathan <unk> , or one of tim ferriss circa tim ferriss that occasionally as a function .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that included .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought , the assignment was something harder .
and yet , there was one , which is where everyone was sure : it needed to be slowed down .
do you forget the mystery of the dark energy in your mind , because now i &apos;m going to give you three key elements to string theory .
it went down to about 10 500 500 .
and he was working decades to explain that number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of those universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers from today , by introducing powerful telescopes into the sky , discovering a handful of <unk> photons -- some kind of <unk> <unk> , billion years ago .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most is a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it , and we want to make it really , really , you want to make it more seriously .
he said , &quot; go ahead , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : so , this is dimitri &apos;s home .
we don &apos;t know there yet .
the next minute , the phone is not going to go on the tv , <unk> , <unk> men on the street , there are <unk> craters on the streets .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporters who worked in the war , the staff of philanthropy , and of course the fearless , brave people of sarajevo themselves .
if i ask why i keep going on why i keep going on , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my job by testimony to this , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us reporters .
even before a goal , it comes out with the joystick <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
we basically <unk> the animals so they could study those <unk> objects and objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we took a number of years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju was completed <unk> .
raise your hand .
the last reason has to do with it is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , on average , one of seven women at the birth of a child dies .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
<unk> <unk> , when he was ceo of the world bank <unk> , once said , &quot; well , it can be good that invest in the education of girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and it was the feather of a bird &apos;s feather .
all of our vertebrae by one of our teammates , we tell us that there is a <unk> .
and even this is true , the suspect of the suspect of being obtained -- like something of the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
one of these ways was that we could have been able to get ourselves into small <unk> .
and they put their pile down , and they say , &quot; i want to swap those balloons against finished arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are sites in this island where they can combine all three or four miles in a new language .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member of those 27 member of those 27 languages , their 23 languages , they &apos;re going to tell them an armed <unk> , they &apos;re going to need an army of <unk> <unk> to be prepared for all of the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also have language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is , is the dark spaces between a text text and the corresponding image , and how the image is changed by the text , and the text is changing through the text .
this is <unk> <unk> , which is about the bottom of the atlantic ocean , and across north america with europe combined with europe .
they &apos;re going to turn this side against this .
but through the idea of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can transform the <unk> movement .
larry <unk> served eight years of a 10 signature <unk> in arizona , in arizona , for the kidnapping and bugs , of a <unk> young boy on a <unk> calculator .
in front of these people , people are left himself to do themselves .
and they brought it to us to texas .
and now they &apos;re going to go with the <unk> , where they &apos;re right now .
it &apos;s just the breadth of space that makes it look like it &apos;s nothing .
something &apos;s called addicted to a sense : the ambition of happiness and human design .
in part , the legacy of <unk> , who aspire to aspire , who aspire to aspire for happiness , it has been dwarfed by <unk> aspects of the individuals , and couldn &apos;t be found in the reality .
so , a <unk> in the science of happiness is that lucky and <unk> are no <unk> in a closed-loop system .
it starts off in <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a three-year-old baby baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to improve status , which is more dominance .
i want to leave with some quotes .
why would you choose rats ?
once the rat understood it , we make a little bit harder to make the task a little bit .
you can actually cure people , even from people who are hiv positive .
knowing that a patient , the microscopic <unk> , until 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be sure that we have saved a lot of lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question is , if i just watch a different person like a other person , why am i not confused , and literally looking at this ball of view as someone is being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
it &apos;s actually not about the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the pollen themselves .
all these images were taken by a <unk> , by the way , in the lab of kew , by kew .
even every one of us has a personal story to tell us about each of us .
we must be as well as the breast cancer campaign to deal with this crisis .
in the same time , in the 1980s when we saw women and death through heart disease , when we kept women and <unk> , she wrote an editorial for the new england advance of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women whose breast vision is <unk> . every time we stretched something , which includes a small amount of radiation , we &apos;re asking , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
well , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they &apos;ve said , they &apos;ve got grassroots trials , and they &apos;ve joined campaigns .
the cells have something like bermuda ; they don &apos;t feel it in the dish .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we recorded eight to 10 hours per day , which we would collect about a quarter million hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> things that came out with a little bit more than a year ago that we really surprised with us .
and finally , my son walks alone in a <unk> period .
three of the most important people in this project philip <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy are here to see here .
and there &apos;s a very intriguing dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son did more than two steps at once -- held in the movie .
and that &apos;s an important thing to ask , because the better we understand how brains create importance , the better ones we can communicate with , and i think the better way we can think together and work together .
it &apos;s kind of a central where you see a picture and thinking , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the stuff . &quot;
so what we &apos;re literally doing is , we &apos;re looking at our teams trying to paint all of the <unk> on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about sanitation , but it &apos;s also about the opportunity .
so don &apos;t put it on there .
if you put it into the building construction sector , if you have a dot-com and a window window , then we &apos;re going to say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that must be repaired .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we went further .
are we just dumb dumb ?
you may skip it in two years when you &apos;re reading eight hours a day .
so in september , they can <unk> and say , &quot; i think today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why do you do it ? &quot;
and the police are on top of the fire service , trying to cut the vehicle in bits to get the power of the driver .
and that goes to the present in the united states with the <unk> in the united states , which is a eye of the divine <unk> .
so , this leads us to -- <unk> , just to say that what we do most is to use digital devices .
that &apos;s the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right hand by stroke .
so this is a very , very low level to get out of health care .
he then gave my <unk> in the right position while he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and an innovator who is fascinated to dismantle in mind if he &apos;s a deaf <unk> , or a blind person , or a blind person , or a blind person .
now , i had to look at the dark years , followed , figure out what i did , if everything that was happening today , was gone .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , they spend time with simon interactions .
and these were developing countries , they had large families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a large <unk> of africa .
and then deng xiaoping came out and brought money to china and bringing the country back to a way .
a search search for which we can copy the data into a semantic shape and publish worldwide , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life , after it came out , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned from there , and i learned about francis crick .
however , there was one in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was selected unhappy ; my girls didn &apos;t married me .
so you can look at dna with dna , and you can look at alternatives like dna .
and so , i &apos;ll leave here by showing you that we &apos;ve seen 20 people with schizophrenia .
on average , it costs two million dollars in one such case two million dollars , and it takes 18 months when they win .
first , don &apos;t look at the patent for the patent , but against the <unk> .
and my solution : do you give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to make it disappear .
&quot; why not ? &quot; they said girls .
the fathers were in a place where they were moving their daughters to play , they could put their chairs out , and they could reach their hand to the dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not really a lot left left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in human survival .
you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and as a result , we needed a different way to eradicate polio than we did it with smallpox .
it has helped to control pandemic development pandemic , sars , for example .
the reality of polio today is something entirely different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are you from the vision of the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how we &apos;ll resurrect polio
dj : so , we discovered these animals now with all kinds of animals , especially with the cats .
and to the surprise of our surprise , it became a <unk> .
for us , this elephant in many ways has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of that hope that we have accompanied our work .
it was incredibly astonishing as she did it in security to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , when i look at these <unk> , <unk> , it reminds me of a very unfortunate human hand , and it &apos;s ironic because your fate is in your hand .
we need it . we respect each other as a husband and a woman , as a community , and as part of this planet and we have to keep doing it .
finally , it seems to be obvious that the earth is large and <unk> , the sun is small and flexible , but it &apos;s worthwhile to remember what <unk> <unk> is about .
and it &apos;s because there &apos;s always a relations in the middle world of the relations .
nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between them , there &apos;s no consensus about their beloved <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as we see it in middle world , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
people like to treat human beings as a research , scientifically , but it &apos;s a <unk> poison , if you want to guess what the question is going to do next to you next .
over night , i became <unk> <unk> at the <unk> age of 40 years old age .
over a cursor i &apos;m controlling with my head , allowing me to see these kinds of photos , video cameras from the robot to see the brain and commands to send me a buttons in a press scanner .
with the help of people like you can make this dream .
so in oceanography , for example , a <unk> dictionary is developed in <unk> , by creating the killer app , visualizing the dolphins , visualizing paintings .
i think together , we can create a global community .
this is a hot blood vessel <unk> .
there are now some -- there are some lessons you can learn from it .
but we don &apos;t usually do this .
i think we tend to look at this , the infrastructure of globalization .
now , that &apos;s gone down for about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we have to solve .
i &apos;m also guessing most of you don &apos;t talk chinese -- which is really sad , when you realize that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do it too .
if you look at this image , you might think , &quot; why would i think of this ? &quot;
but there are these disparate techniques that allow us to go out and look at the world and find its place in place .
they would transcend wealth and safety , religious violence and make sure that states never <unk> germs again .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love that dish .
and the war , which took 20 million people to live -- until the days of civil war in the world .
<unk> sen : who is this guy , &quot; i should have gotten all of this money , but i spent all of these time looking for the american man .
chinese restaurants have largely done the same , i &apos;d argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized <unk> .
in contrast , general tso chicken , which started in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started working in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so , what we see in the 17th century , 18th century , is the <unk> search for cancer replication , making the same thing .
so people would have a real big <unk> .
so when the <unk> started becoming less , i became increasingly <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember having to walk towards every child on every line ?
at 18 and 19 , i went to sleep with the night .
again , i &apos;m going to get slightly depressed and something <unk> .
many of us realize that in the next few years , there are a lot to do with building a better world .
he moves around , &quot; what does it feel like to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work at the very treatment of the most important problems that we have done , which made themselves from the opportunities of haiti and climate change ?
if you <unk> the impossible , you make it possible .
but we &apos;ve achieved a deal with climate change .
and there was crying god .
the <unk> does something remarkable : they &apos;re using two ingredients , proteins and water , who are in charge of creating a material that is suitable for protection , comparable to technical fibers like kevlar .
or you <unk> beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch it .
here you see what it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i want to use art for creating technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that goes round and round the round and round of round and <unk> -- hopefully none -- to help him meet some of his next choices .
what am i going to do ? &quot;
and yet , in the process of this , unprecedented demonstration demonstration , heather knight , a <unk> shoe , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he &apos;s collecting the feedback &apos; s , and it &apos;s based on his behavior on scale . does this thing work ?
stanley milgram , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> , has been <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> that there were between two random people being connected to only five to seven or seven times .
what drives our opinion about relations with very cooperative groups ?
however , there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and perhaps where he might have translated into the ear .
um ... my dad , a <unk> ?
it was his father , who decided they needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility , despite his teenage ages of 17 , and he had his fault to be a <unk> <unk> , because he had stayed out of a camp while his friends were stayed from a camp while his friends were stayed , kept him for his whole life .
and as my classmates , and my <unk> abandoned , kind of <unk> , my dad dropped false papers .
i asked him , in the face of the victim , who he had asked if he had to do that .
we grow from a few million people to the seven billion people we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> level at <unk> level , which appears to be a good state for the next trash , which appears to be in a good state .
when you go through the <unk> , the perimeter line at the <unk> limit , you &apos;re able to remain stable with the ability to remain stable .
with the observations of 80-year-old , fishermen , the <unk> great barrier reef , and scientists , that the great barrier of japan is shifting under the united states .
but the drama of course , of course , is clear that <unk> is not an option option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today , because i think i really like everybody in all of the way .
this is a <unk> of a race of a long cultural race .
first of all , he used to use an ancient way of creating the <unk> , and linking this three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology at that time .
and by the process of <unk> sugar in black <unk> , i hired portraits of them .
it became very big pictures , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
and my interest in <unk> , especially of worse <unk> , is very far enough .
in behind , one sequence that is also the same in the chimps .
and then we can ask : is there subpopulations differences between africans and <unk> ?
and then they can compare it with the genome from today , and then they can look at it with the genome from today .
we then can ask ourselves to do the same thing , as for neanderthals : have mixed with ancestors among us today from people &apos;s mitochondrial dna ?
there are many people designing their own vision , like this view of the beginning of the 20th century .
in my own faith , the airplane of the future holds his mind .
imagine growing <unk> in a 3d printer , and you &apos;re embedded in a <unk> suspension , and follow the forces that are happening in its components .
they weren &apos;t talking . but especially , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
we now know it &apos;s about one 100 .
you &apos;re looking at a video .
you have a sense that the research that you have with is actually capable of actually having a impact on reality , that they can actually prevent those experiences that they can actually prevent those experiences in that area .
then you &apos;ll fall off .
<unk> <unk> you <unk> yourself in a rigid body position -- picking up on her forehead , arms extended above your <unk> .
they did everything exactly the way we &apos;d taught them .
and after the battle , they bring these mobile contacts , and they do what they call &quot; <unk> , &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
people have changed themselves too .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
that &apos;s not timely .
and she showed up on the left to tell me how the dark of this picture was being represented by the idea of being represented by the idea of being black .
it &apos;s really in the spirit of appreciating that i have a new series of questions i ask .
now , that &apos;s kind of an apparent statement .
and the children said , &quot; how to do that . &quot;
i think they try to multiply numbers .
so , i said , &quot; how long do you feel about it before you decided you &apos;ve understood nothing ? &quot;
their <unk> increased in 50 , which is to get hotter in delhi &apos;s own <unk> biotechnology with a biotechnology biotechnology teacher .
76 percent . in the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be vinci out there .
these are 10-year-old .
all of a sudden , i saw from the dark side on the dark side of the location of space that had been kept on the moon .
if i had to take the entire story on a picture , what would it be ?
now , i &apos;m going to show you some brief from my other big big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a hurry .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand it .
so , blue , blue , everything became blue .
i &apos;m going to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s kind of acting on the interface of health and business business .
let &apos;s think of the markets as the <unk> <unk> we have , and figure out what price people would pay for , so they would have the dignity of choice , so they would have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two polygons and 10 television sets .
the little bit of it went out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very well . it &apos;s slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i work with .
tissue from existing density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to using these models for self-reflection .
thank you .
and just trying to shut them off , like the attempt to try and shoot an arrow with the <unk> , it was hard work , and young , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now , let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on the projects -- even more sophisticated designs , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , at the institute of technology , at darpa , the institute of the caribbean and the university of los angeles .
let &apos;s just be careful just behave like this out of wood or so .
now i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go beyond forever .
these are about two billion .
he takes it to his estimates about &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget the one .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it is a metaphor for the time that we &apos;re living in , in the human mind , and machines can pool together .
i got very clear mass . where come from it ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the kind of free wild in 20 to 30 years could extinction .
every evidence suggesting that this cancer is transmitted from one virus .
i took the opportunity true , and i took some samples from jonas &apos; blood from jonas &apos; blood and a few samples from others .
she got him for the veterinarian and he took a little <unk> .
finally , cancer is a very reactive implication of the ability of our cells to share and adapt to your environment .
and i &apos;m not alone there .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation makes us not happy .
but they didn &apos;t realize the numbers on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> of the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not breaking us when we &apos;re conscious conscious .
but what we then see in the 21st century is asia , moving back to home more than half of the world &apos;s population , and about half of the global economy .
you could look at this as the overall performance of the <unk> .
after 1958 out the soviets , it said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re in japan or fresh delhi or <unk> , your view of china &apos;s ascent will be something different than if they &apos;re living in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we put this into larger historical context , we will be able to do that process .
and what we &apos;re redefining is our national interests , so it &apos;s not just a domestic <unk> .
this is the conventional approach .
this is typically the responsibility for <unk> to <unk> a stable company .
they are interdependent with each other .
jobs for who ? especially young men .
after most typically the law has collapsed , you cannot algorithmically even the rights .
the supplies would be delivered by the way that conflict <unk> , government delivered .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has dropped it , but they call the climate change in the world , the security and stability , when governments around the world are debating how to react in the world .
it allows them to be more productive , so they can &apos;t afford the insurance .
these are obviously inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to optimize for a <unk> world .
listen like chinese students practice english as they shout it out .
teacher : perfect ! student : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> on abstractions , which we aspire to aspire to do , and we take the hypothetical seriously , which is more than what it is .
luria would look at people in the scientific century before they went into the scientific age , and they found themselves resistant to these people resistant to a taxonomy of the concrete world .
and there said luria , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t only the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would they have killed it killed ? &quot;
they might say , half half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to do a degree of anything .
he &apos;s still in those red numbers , but chris did it with personal famine , that movie <unk> .
i &apos;m one of your teammates .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> , and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; <unk> is serious .
we were all angry at them , &quot; what do you do ?
this becomes a lot of true when you read it . &quot;
we had always played this game throughout the school for weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had basically tackled all 50 <unk> <unk> deployed .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people announced a lot of <unk> jobs , and <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like his own little ties .
if i put all three legs out of it , in the three corner of the triangle , i would get a sponge ball .
so everything you do -- it &apos;s a very detailed proposition -- this ancient <unk> and this old plastic , and this old plastic is very simple in the old plastic .
that &apos;s possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> rev. paper -- you can be in an ecstatic school or in a <unk> school -- a sheet , a ruler and a pen , no breaks .
what we do , is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
this is a small straw what you do , is these two quarters <unk> here , it becomes like a <unk> .
here are two magnets magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they got bored , so they got bored they put it on his deck .
at the <unk> conference , demonstrates <unk> <unk> demonstrates a simple thing and yet stunning plans to turn trash into a lot of constructed toys that kids themselves can build themselves themselves -- as they learn from basic principles of science and creation .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples from the biology of biology .
and there are a few examples of projects trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can transform a position of traffic traffic into one , the open space for people , which is open source space for people , bringing people back into opportunities .
this picture was taken at the day when it was completed , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you pour seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate is calcium carbonate .
no , you &apos;ve got to go out and explore the people &apos;s minds with visions . &quot;
i was looking for someone who &apos;s jewish , because i &apos;m jewish , and i &apos;m looking at it .
but the actual <unk> was that there were very many men who wanted to go out with me .
very few of us have the ability to be completely honest with yourself .
he likes to travel , as long as it can &apos;t be on a <unk> .
i tried to make sense of how malleable it is .
because they remember my <unk> , they have to reach out of 700 points of 700 points , and nobody did .
most of them . <unk> are 33 years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the fossil record , the deterioration of tomorrow &apos;s old adults are older adults .
imagine if your eyesight is very , very well .
these <unk> actually have many other benefits in attention to attention , and one aspect of attention , which is also improved strength , is our ability to chase objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to take this result , and put it in context in the context of another group of ownership , a group that actually lived in our society , from people who are acting high school .
so let me explain this step with a task that is called mental spinning .
it &apos;s the idea of calculation .
let &apos;s just run out all kinds of stuff in the specific case that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project , from which i was not even sure about it .
and wolfram alpha knows many , many things .
on the one hand , we have conversations , with its kind of abstract , <unk> language and a big network of <unk> developed ability , able to create a lot of just a bunch of lines .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to kind of used to go to the world and realizing that certain compounds useful for certain technology and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about the discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules , which one theory theory has successfully reproduce , and the general theory of gravity and gravity and at least straws on quantum theory .
sw : i think i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more specifically , and teachers who <unk> me , hiv / aids .
they &apos;re jumping up . they &apos;re carrying red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she had no right on estate and all owned by everything my family owned anyway , anyway , my dad had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we performed , we were excited , and had never slept the night .
he wore talking and in a village that hadn &apos;t even <unk> <unk> roads . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do whatever they wanted from me to ask .
when it was pregnant , the mother was pregnant with it , and was disciplined .
as we speak here , 100,000 twenty-five girls will never be more <unk> .
consumers who represent the 72 percent of the american gdp , actually beginning , just like banks and companies <unk> paying attention to the daily life , in daily life , themselves from situations and taking risks that we face when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> and <unk> future education , the future children of our households .
<unk> percent are gone by 48 percent who are learning institute at yale institute .
we also watch a trend to something called tourism tourism . right ?
one of them is the local community of community and neighborhood , and our neighbors &apos; neighbors than supportive .
we also observe a big fibroid .
the trend line is immensely enormously .
then we &apos;re still going to take the phenomenon from <unk> .
and then i came the question , i &apos;m the only one who does something like this ?
you might be able to use them .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories say , writing stories , and today i &apos;m going to share with you some stories about the art of storytelling and some supernatural creatures , the <unk> creatures .
our monarch butterfly might disintegrate . our core muscles might <unk> , and our core muscles could remain <unk> , if we were too much longer within our cultural cultural milieu .
i came across for the first time , as i call it , &quot; chop foreigner . &quot;
i &apos;m not <unk> , a refugee or a <unk> , and i &apos;m asked why i do it , but it allows between languages to help me innovate .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge story , because i became prosecution suffered .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i might write a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will become a happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so you do . you &apos;re taking existing pieces of existing songs , cut them into little bits bits , and shapes them up , and so you get a new song , but this new song is clearly made out of old songs .
instead of using those laws and laws worldwide , they have a rather radical comparison on the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to wrap what it covers out -- <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the bmw by putting a symbol of its leg by putting a symbol of its fingers .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from the inside .
and then they say , &quot; ok , but how do you see her address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , some kind of <unk> marshes out of the limb .
our probe of our solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
so this led to an understanding of the <unk> structure , because it &apos;s so <unk> that atoms have a single core , with nostrils agents that put it together .
this picture is a galaxy , a <unk> galaxy , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually transform the most fundamental ideas for us , about our place in the universe , and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is home . this is us .
and with each click and every touch of the screen , we like <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information all over our way through the apparent forests .
and when our daughter sits on the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even respond to this brain region .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much argued and i wanted to talk about my 27th birthday , i decided i would not discuss more than a day -- a day .
and you don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained from a friend &apos;s work that my sign understood , that i was john francis , i went through my life that i was not talking , and that was going to be the last time someone would translate my sign language .
well , i saw my backpack again again .
i started talking again , because i had studied <unk> .
but the ironic thing was that i did about my birthday on my birthday , but never did my mind to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in swap games for food .
i was constantly worried that i was going to send ourselves and send me back again .
i felt so powerless , because i had so much food in america , but my father had died of hunger .
but i firmly believe that their gesture of love and <unk> can also transform life of another joseph joseph , and have thousands of other bodies that have hope that still have the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to try to test new materials for buildings , but it was much more intense than i was expected to make and waterproof , and as an industrial manufacturing process also .
but then , i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we &apos;re not working for society , but for all of our people , the government , the government , contractor .
and then in the next year , 95 , there was a big earthquake earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i &apos;m going to ask myself , what is a <unk> building and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really needed .
so we learn some of the most important things in our life before we are born in the womb .
so it turns out , so that fetuses are actually learning the particular language , which is to be born in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it turns out there &apos;s a mixture of horror that are as individually as individualistic and curious , as the woman themselves .
why should lead malnutrition in the womb ?
you can see , but you can see in other eyes .
this faith in the recycling system is essential for every kind of concentration system .
the audience will <unk> <unk> <unk> , which are very logical , but not with what happens in front of your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe even to smile , you might even be able to smile .
you might remember this as the <unk> roller , ok . back then as the largest deal of all the times .
so , if you &apos;re a very serious animal in the world , and someone says , &quot; what does you do for the eliminating of starvation in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we take an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i &apos;m not suggesting that strategy plays a role .
for me , all the music .
now , when i look at my software , the camera sees the camera <unk> , and it &apos;s serving the location of the <unk> interface , and you have a whiteboard system , and you have a whiteboard system .
i remember that the poor need needed something -- food , clothing , shelter -- whatever they hadn &apos;t .
i felt even a bit of shame <unk> <unk> .
now , because i heard him speak , i was excited about different reasons .
i didn &apos;t even get asked by a class , which was generally my way .
it &apos;s about the privacy of the story , and it &apos;s about giving us a way to get into what their dignity would say , a partnership , which is a partnership , which is based on a traditional kind of classroom .
it &apos;s a very strong combination combination , a very strong combination .
right now , <unk> is still at the beginning , and it &apos;s kind of irrelevant , but it &apos;s very clear to me that it is only one vehicle , only one tool .
what does humanity look like ?
now , now , i &apos;m going to ask myself to second big question : are we alone , or are there other life in the universe ?
the answer to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done some remarkable breakthroughs in the last hundred years .
look at this here .
here are photos from myself .
indeed , the rate is doubling every 18 months and every <unk> member of the caribbean knows , that &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what will they do with them ?
they sail them in their <unk> across the sky and occasionally deprive them of experiments that their parents wouldn &apos;t agree .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
and beyond generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do those experiments at all .
and what i found out was that the first technology appeared in <unk> million years ago in molds .
<unk> , we can learn a lot of it .
and i look at <unk> and try to protect my child , because with such a child , you don &apos;t get a secretary of state .
and second , they &apos;re going to say that they had a <unk> gang , but some changes for the climb of trees .
up until now , our knowledge of our ancestors , basically from adult individuals , because the fossils , the <unk> , were missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> studying mankind &apos;s origin in the vast majority of ethiopia . he &apos;s talking about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn in africa over our human mortality .
and if everybody needs to think about the rules , obviously , of course , an effective system for <unk> and <unk> because we &apos;ve noticed , in everything we &apos;ve discovered , is also critical to control .
it &apos;s seen as a high seas , because the continent is about <unk> <unk> .
we have to work local , but also <unk> <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol <unk> says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was a pretty good idea .
to say i &apos;m journalist , i &apos;m not a technologist , so i want to generate a sketch of what the present and the future will look like .
finally , i think we all have to think about whether we want to make our reality -- and , if , what it means for our idea of life , and everything that comes afterwards .
it looks like it looks like oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and <unk> opinion of the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i was trying to write an article for the new york times , and try to explain how it works .
of course , we can do this .
and earning a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try that . probably everything goes wrong .
<unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> did it again , but he could never prove the guess .
i would like to suggest that our approach is simply unsustainable .
china wants to have done in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even even slow down even more slowly .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it becomes ugly , and it &apos;s going to happen , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen soon in our lifespans -- but we are more able to transcend everything that is headed towards us .
and here they come into the game .
and what we have to think about is what we have to do is dance in flames , what is next ?
and we believed , we could put this debt on our children on our children , but imagine them .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what level of development is the cell .
that should not be an astonishing thing , or ?
all we have got is rigor .
they &apos;ll be able to look at their constipation , maybe exceeds the sensitivity , or maybe they can do a series of things that we cannot do .
that &apos;s not a thousand years in a distant distance .
we should use those cheap , simple <unk> , and none of them should use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see that overall sign .
we cannot risk the customer &apos;s trust .
he just got 500 and allowed to have 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge jar of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when they &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kinds of web -- the things that we &apos;re talking about -- is something less than 5,000 days old days old .
of course , the internet has been more than 5,000 days -- but the web exists only 5,000 days .
so , as we say , the machine we &apos;re talking about is now a rodent brain , a human brain , if we look at the rate with which is growing , in 30 years , six billion years ago .
now , it &apos;s not -- if you &apos;re doing a spreadsheet and stuff at work , a word processor , they &apos;re not part of the internet , they &apos;re not part of the web , but they &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will become the extended sense of machine , &quot; in some sense .
it will be at the level level or ideas or words , if you will .
the final point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;ll be obtained .
third , it becomes ubiquitous , it will be more ubiquitous and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within one week , i was convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ occurred that it was sun <unk> moon , and i was being prepared by god <unk> , and i was being prepared by god <unk> .
these are the deaths from <unk> .
and it cuts everything . it makes everything out of course .
so i &apos;m going to start with some basic ideas like how we wrap things together .
so this is a project that we &apos;re currently completed for a huge pharmaceutical company , which is right out of this process , which is a result of a multiplicity of forces that we are developing .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false configuration because it &apos;s probably more interesting to be more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas for the educational education help young people do .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each of them is going to go to your neighbors .
so , as we have to pay school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage because we can change our surroundings .
my story , though , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has an <unk> brain .
and that <unk> is very , very important , because there can be <unk> .
we have learned to talk about the big brain , tastes and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who can still name themselves in the night sky .
of course , we have the reckless monks of the monks .
the post , the post , on which the sun is hangs on , is actually a heat ray that looks at the light behind the sacred <unk> of machu picchu , the <unk> , called <unk> picchu .
when they pray for the dead adventists , they do with the hands of these gestures , which they put their thoughts into the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the large mother <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world who created the hills and creating the homeland they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s really unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material you all know , is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
so , i slow down there , you put in there , because in a hundred years , my body cannot come back into the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you &apos;re going to apply it anywhere in the world , and don &apos;t need to worry about <unk> or <unk> , because you &apos;ve got plenty of alternatives .
first of all , they get atoms in a special bottle .
i launched a competition in front of four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is 15 trillion dollars in charge .
and that &apos;s -- -- this is a lot more <unk> than all speakers before me and all those who will come to me .
and she thought about my work of mathematical models that should promote a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience likes head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons -- they think it &apos;s serious -- and find out a different pattern of a lot of interesting -- inflationary .
you can think of two ways .
if you toss a coin , you get a sequence of your head and number two .
back into more secular societies , because of dealing with uncertainty , because of dealing with uncertainty .
and only by one percent .
he said , &quot; i guess what , after a sudden death of a sudden death in a family , the odds of one another . &quot;
not as long as one in 73 million , but yet , quite unlikely .
the whole quality control system , the far extremes of impact on the industrial processing , is driven by statistics .
perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives have saved hundreds of thousands worldwide worldwide .
it &apos;s an intelligent outlet , <unk> , because the power is from , until an intelligent <unk> , is going to be detected . simple .
but , on the other side , china is a <unk> . a term of <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve got facebook ; we &apos;ve got <unk> sharks .
and yet , the <unk> themselves can create a very strong force , which has never been seen in the history of china .
so , as china is looking at this <unk> device , it &apos;s not just as just a superficial headlines .
like a big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> really changed , and they &apos;ve done more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data anymore , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more and more chinese , free speech , and human rights , as a filler from america , instead of a gathering of america .
many of you know the beethoven &apos;s ninth symphony .
i &apos;m not saying they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can quite nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than speech .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his <unk> had been taken away to try to finally reduce the causes of death , which is why there &apos;s been <unk> and put his skull on the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant . he &apos;s brilliant .
and i look at myself , in this <unk> audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s one other thing .
at this big point in the dutch history , my father at the <unk> of the <unk> river was near <unk> .
civil wars and oppression has dropped since the end of the cold war since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers uses these weapons as tools as the tools of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a weapon
this program takes shape and <unk> , and then there &apos;s 250 dna sequences out there .
this is a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in yosemite yosemite yosemite yosemite yosemite .
you cannot be fluffy .
i &apos;m very interested in the two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there is actually theoretical rationale for why technology progresses in a very idealistic fashion .
well , the evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution actually applied the technology to organize the next level , which is the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world in three-dimensional world ; we can use third dimension to the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent discount growth per year , 28 percent of growth in dollars .
another big revolution is <unk> .
so , in order to come out of computing growth from computing : 1,000 bucks on computing , currently on the brain of any insect or one mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to reach the complete maturity of these trends , and you &apos;ve got to appreciate how often the thickness used in the form of technology -- faster and faster , when we enter that point .
they can blessing , and they can bring bullets together with each other .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , here &apos;s not supposed to be here .
dopamine appears to be the stuff that is related to <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we call schizophrenia .
and he was so eager to post that , and give us the resolution of resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought experiment , and they &apos;re a <unk> in the african <unk> .
9 / 11 has a guess . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our teammates , and we have a do-it-yourself product .
so , i wasn &apos;t as good as he did , but we did it , <unk> n <unk> , <unk> , tracy <unk> and bruce <unk> on a <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; tell us the truth , &quot; and let us do .
musician and activist peter gabriel discusses his own personal motivation with the <unk> <unk> of human rights and told stories of active dilemmas .
next thing we wondered , what do we do ?
he sees the problem and he knows how to manage it . the dance is <unk> , it allows him to be <unk> .
the beetle does a lot less drop on the ball , when they carve on some kind of <unk> when they don &apos;t have them .
here &apos;s our <unk> experimenter .
play a <unk> and watch what happens .
this is the universe by stephen hawking .
thank you .
oddly enough argument , it &apos;s fun to fall into these big adventures , isn &apos;t quite true with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandma does go next year to antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the vc that they &apos;re entrepreneurs to invest in and make a ton of money to do it .
and beyond the experience , to create a business venture or something -- doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
there are no financially stable corporation , who there are no problems in which there are no problems .
from there they take them with -- on a <unk> , good way up to the top , right from the beginning , right from the beginning to the end .
if i happen to know someone who &apos;s made such a device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition comes to <unk> patterns .
hopefully everything positive , positive positive , positive positive , positive positive .
if they follow my ideas , they &apos;ll have a <unk> , very <unk> powerpoint presentation , so that &apos;s great to add up who they are and to join emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s kind of cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you derive something off , you might have an effect on that .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table at the end table , in the last place , as the culture is not estimates .
as we think , as we think and behave , we broke our oxygen system .
we have a serious meme to be serious .
but even pardon me , the problems today are not the problems of industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
through a gradual change , change , like transparency , change , such as transparency , and collaboration , collaboration collaboration , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way to get things done , which is the only way to get rid of the old <unk> , and to find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we cannot be alone . we &apos;re supposed to do it together , and if we can do it and share the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria into something better .
so for <unk> magazine , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because of the <unk> of the <unk> at the time .
after i had left them with one hand by hand , they were very -- and i was accepted for about six months and i was working there for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , <unk> and henry .
we <unk> many magazines , we did our homework , but we were looking at what we were looking for , we were surrounded by images like this .
this image literally arose in seconds after me took the baby into the arms , and i put it across it .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : you &apos;re not talking about your miscarriage -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better at <unk> , since i was born into the wonders of birth and family .
but what you &apos;re finding is that you &apos;re looking at losing control in terms of wonderful ways , which is how we think of our life as a lot of sense , which is extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;ll start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all of these &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine being able to hear <unk> <unk> now , as you would play yourself . john <unk> walker shows how shots at the inverse and <unk> are able to analyze it , and then they can analyze it on psychoanalysis wings .
well , since then , we &apos;ve seen a period of remarkable economic <unk> , the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , like well , politicians also like to go in there , like , &quot; in the <unk> apple , you don &apos;t biting the face of sugar , you can &apos;t conceal your borders , you can &apos;t conceal it .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand this , until i met this guy , a respectful , <unk> man who <unk> from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also a future where society <unk> a few basic elements of capitalism , which is how to integrate the dna with <unk> innovation in society by creating things that work , and then they are the ones that work , <unk> and <unk> .
so i &apos;m going to show you a very intriguing new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights i &apos;ve been working on , the relationship between the structure of the language they &apos;re talking about , and they &apos;re going to conserve their direction .
and if i wants to talk correctly , forces me constantly to think about it all the time .
now , this is a very reactive theory .
so , you can &apos;t hold this device so you can measure your <unk> hand , so i can measure your <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability is to communicate across generations across generations .
we kind of <unk> them all the way .
but i am about to use it as a challenge .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was involved in the field of <unk> corporation , although i got a phd in <unk> .
human and <unk> and giraffes and everything , the red line here is going up . these are people , both and pets .
we &apos;ve focused more on serious <unk> of the future goods and producing products for the company .
let &apos;s look at the next video .
and this flew out at dinner , and -- you see , you can see what it looks like , and you can see every <unk> that you would like to .
and he was a lot about how people practiced the buddhist religion in the india at the time .
and he goes back to the village , and he goes back to the village .
and he &apos;s got to close his eyes , so it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in charge of one of them people . people are people .
we feel bigger . we take sense of remind memory of a mother and a lot of this stuff on the ground in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course , they are cruel and <unk> to others .
so even though the change in your mind has done something for other beings , you have the new quality in you , and it helps you , and it &apos;s serving you as a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of handle , one of the society used tools to get the public health .
interestingly , complexity is very highly evolving .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very , very simple once you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four <unk> warning , one example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to hang them with details , but on the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of what we do .
do they have started to do that ?
and from this point of view , what <unk> said about what our new style of organization is , what our new kinds of organization is , or better commitment , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of the things will always be less in the use , and it will just manifest themselves in the use of cooperation with the <unk> .
for example , astronomy , which suggests that yochai had talked about it .
there &apos;s also going to be a professional arguments as well .
so there &apos;s no dispute about two camp , but between these camps there will be all sorts of interesting conclusions that are taken from people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to bring their snorkel to someone else , and actually a team has done it -- between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was , was to thank him for this .
but the reality is that life is occurring right here .
so , i call people up and they have news like this .
he said , &quot; i am dressed as batman to keep my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have a data set , which turns out they had moved right into another city and took a new job .
and in the past 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , from everything , from genes about brain elements , dopamine and things like that , until the <unk> .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on your sex .
and that was one of those cases , because there was no violence among her ancestors , but my father .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can possibly be .
by the way , i got an email today , by the way , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas atlas .
and these guys are the weak force , which may be the least known .
so , if you want to know why , why the sky is blue , or therefore , you should link up with a <unk> computer -- why dna does the shape you have now .
and the comparison is that the people in this room are the higgs .
but it &apos;s really true that with this theory , the theory seems to stand up at the time of the big bang -- an absolutely beautiful prediction , and the model has not been made with the goal of doing it , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , which turns out to convert dark into light , which enables civilization to see civilization from space .
another big insight came from an investigation of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the <unk> dynasty <unk> <unk> .
in a very similar study in germany , researchers used to use researchers in <unk> villages , and after they had <unk> <unk> , they had to <unk> smile .
&quot; because the color that you have ordered is not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; what ? why ? why ? were there a more police officer ? &quot;
we created the shining <unk> , which people , people , from <unk> , trying to think they &apos;d traveled from abroad , when they were <unk> to their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; i think you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it already . &quot;
in port-au-prince in port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came out and <unk> <unk> for cellphones .
one visualization for the transformational power of technology is found in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion gallons in the world .
in the stores of the environment , the batteries and bread <unk> .
the flow of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a tennis court , in the <unk> , which leads to rose .
do you see an author with a writer ?
and as i look at the great bears , i remember looking at his head as a kid on his head to slide from his shoulder , and i feel myself again like this baby .
we &apos;ve seen again how creative technology can be , and in our life and we can do those solutions , we can choose those solutions , innovations and moments , that flow from the flow of time .
my mother was <unk> .
in every one refugee camp , they had to lock soldiers who had my old brother mark , who wanted to do my old brother , who wanted to make him a child soldiers .
and i should do it all by ourselves .
take anything you want , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in <unk> , because i didn &apos;t hate my emotions .
thank you .
so almost all of life on earth is about five times five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why would that play role ?
so theoretically , theoretically , we can grow any organ from any organ from any cell .
here is the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the line .
so if they rotate with the same speed at the same speed , floating on the robot .
and you see how resistant it is to control .
and he does this while he &apos;s obstacles <unk> .
they take your neighbors true .
what this demonstrates here is we can double double the <unk> , triple , <unk> , where we get them to make teams as you see here , as you can see here .
but the robots can also find out where it wants to go .
and i can feel that . but there is so much more so many , and i want to expand your mind here , that awareness open and change your view of bees .
it has been a huge problem for many years , basically , for the last chapter in the late 1980s , with a lot of different viruses , bacteria and <unk> associated with it .
you don &apos;t see that .
they take the cooks for their courts . and the honey -- they have <unk> -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees are dying when they diverge , they didn &apos;t want to do it either .
ok , now , the question is , why is this ?
of course , especially in the last decade , we &apos;ve done it , especially in the world with a dense chain of temperature , with a chain of global trade .
and never before , as many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , many of them don &apos;t know that our bread , of course , was not european invention .
and especially cutting rates in <unk> , and china is going to turn up high rates .
<unk> for most people , and here are not a lot of farmers who are being paid to be bad , to <unk> the environment , to be large , to <unk> the environment .
everything comes together .
so while i &apos;m doing my bread -- and i did it <unk> , and i don &apos;t try to burn my hands .
it also has to think about a lot of time in the country where there are available tools , materials and <unk> .
you take someone like me , analyze a scientists , analyze and test and develop a new technology , and you create the quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you take this from here today , a new bond with nature .
this was a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is about last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur had a film about them , <unk> queen , who would you see them .
but i think the most important is that we can do it .
but this has <unk> <unk> as a specialty .
this is a <unk> patient who then had 73 -- it needed to be a priori , decided to do this .
i like this slide , because they &apos;re going to talk about what motivates people motivates what motivates people really motivates what people don &apos;t like .
if you eat a cushioned meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat even more fat than ever , because even more carbs , so the average number is lower , and yet the actual number is lower , the actual number , but the actual number is higher , the goal is to reduce both of them .
and one of the most disciplined studies of <unk> study found that 70 percent of people used to cure , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of people had dropped out of food , 54 percent of them , that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is an intimacy <unk> , <unk> .
i hope he doesn &apos;t stay alive .
the movie is based on a <unk> <unk> of f. scott <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the projects : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to make sense of creating the technology and technology .
we &apos;re kind of forced ourselves from motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinity .
and that &apos;s the data we get from it , and then it &apos;s used for the model .
and this is what the game looked like was used in the movie .
that was a very , very early sample sample .
and we discovered that , in the midst of state , we saw this in the state of karnataka .
and it has a custom <unk> .
the people of <unk> are going to overcome those cruel , <unk> past , where they lived their lives throughout their lives .
we were <unk> -- two degrees as a driver -- and imagine it , this is a sea floor from sand , 40 degrees c , one water bottle .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use it as similar as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another movie .
i don &apos;t pretend to skip my core temperature until my core temperature goes down to 40 degrees c -- enough to break an egg .
<unk> , thank you for inviting me .
begin to begin with a poem . that would be an idea .
but what would you like , if you &apos;d never seen , like the next day they would like a living god in the world , their shoulders into the clouds , or whether they &apos;re sitting there downstairs in the bottom line from the wallpaper they &apos;re falling out there with their little toys ?
who could sleep quiet in this night ?
but knew that judy <unk> in our old 150,000 dollars in his old 150,000 dollars a film that was created in <unk> , and <unk> <unk> his bedroom , had no longer waiting , i mean he invented the calculator .
at the end of the end , they sat down in a tree and they lined up with each other hand .
and the human connectome is more than that , but if you remove those two columns , probably wouldn &apos;t be there anymore .
we also have the problem with elephants , which is , you know , that you can &apos;t build it , that would be hard for an individual elephant .
one component of this is understanding . here a <unk> , &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the others and sharing . &quot;
so now , what we &apos;re looking at is more complex programming data . this is relief .
the test isn &apos;t good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple job that they have to do .
even a philosopher , even though it was impossible , it was impossible for fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not a lonely kooks , it &apos;s not two mad , three is a lot of power .
and i spent the last decade i spent trying to expose pain and defenses , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i listened to , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , we can create serious <unk> .
jacobs jacobs : how to ensure that healthy life
and i think a lot of <unk> sharing this vision .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were reproduced , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask about the part of the story that is not being told .
-- a priest ?
finally , one group of people who believe that the indus people today is the ancestor of the people living in today .
on the right to streamlined , how many ? ok .
it can be useful to create more useful in producing more data which then is <unk> .
this sign is the main number of the indus script , and only in that text , it appears twice .
it turns out , in india , it has a very long tradition , name on the basis of leadership at the base of the time .
outer space , we all know what it looks like .
this is <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the name bell of bell .

but also a lot of the right , which appears to be driven by propaganda .

if i took that pink sound for longer than a couple of minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
a lot of people vague themselves , but these turn big big , public spaces like these , multiple spaces like these , multiple spaces , in millions of tiny spaces .
you can do it also in a beautiful place like a lake .
and finally , an <unk> .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you very much for having here . we &apos;re all so appreciative .
and so they went off .
because they were not sitting on the pavement and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my <unk> , a exchange of ours , a biotechnology that was fair to them , and they seemed resistant to them .

but sometimes science has some other qualities that they &apos;re really interesting , really interesting .
what gives us more data there ?
there &apos;s something we believe , obviously , obviously , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as very smart , not in a human nature .
in humans , in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most sophisticated part of the construction system with the name , <unk> part of the neocortex . nature has this little shot .
it &apos;s not that they look at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a <unk> . it &apos;s not in the least like a <unk> .

we did the experiment with the same groups , <unk> , but one wants a delay between the enlightenment of how we deal with the data and the actual beginning of <unk> .
the price of that is the refused from paradise .
and they moved themselves and they rubbed each other and they &apos;d run their arms up to each other and <unk> them .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and safety and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about characters .

the bad words -- notice , when someone thinks a place , and then he doesn &apos;t find it on the map , and then he says , &quot; this map sucks . &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , when we think that words are tools that we use to make our mind expression , how do you know that carrots are thinner than hammer ?
and the <unk> , 33 different <unk> definitions for a set of set .
and then there &apos;s this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i have all the time &quot; dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary .
so , i get a chair .
and to make a long story short , this is what i ended up .
and by this , during those three days , during those three days , you begin to see : why do i hear all of this stuff ?
you may be from a ted speakers , and therefore we can keep the conversation during the year and go next year , according to the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the companies don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> into their cheap <unk> tower , because they &apos;re not sure what the public is going to start with such precise input , which could even fold in the public .
there was a shortage of cheating , if that was already <unk> , and was unable to be able to find the broadcasters .
instead of <unk> circles , you &apos;re <unk> you .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> , and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the <unk> of a <unk> people .
we debate about what the world needs now is nuclear -- -- right or wrong ?
and yet there is only three main base of this -- coal and gas , water , <unk> , that almost anywhere is used -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;re going to go out the russian warheads by spun into electricity .
<unk> emissions are degrading emissions emissions from greenhouse gases emissions and particles , which will cause warming , and turned into co2 emissions .
now , if you look at the fact that nuclear weapon of nuclear weapon , nuclear proliferation with nuclear power , because of course we know that india and pakistan developed nuclear nuclear weapon through <unk> <unk> .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
reality is that 21 states have nuclear nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need both parties from parties -- only one or two member of them are necessary to add global warming in the senate in the senate , and this system can help .
we &apos;re only not going to get energy from renewable sources .
i used to worry about 10,000 years old , for the last 10,000 years .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was by apollo <unk> .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of the hands of some less people , and the available technology that will allow us to explore the exploration of space exploration .
26 groups from seven countries had the competition , and every one had between one and 25 million u.s. u.s.
rp : we can bring them back at the space station .
and the virtue of the sponsor is the aggregate of the <unk> and the social media .
would you be surprised us , <unk> ?
so that means that surfaces can cut themselves , they can incredibly small .
a challenge of how we can put this new algorithmic signature in a pillar .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we only saw the outside the outside , was that the surfaces were further down and <unk> inside the column , and that was a rather surprising discovery .
inspired by the evolution of cell division michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , intriguing shapes with millions of surfaces -- no human being able to create them by hand , but you can build them , and they could create our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this image here -- many shapes dancing here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , actually , the chip <unk> , even the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s operated by young people .
and i think many people in this room , many of them are in the same position as me .
so i think women in our society are going to be leaders in our society , because they realize it &apos;s very important generations of preserving our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve been recognized , since recently , more people use youtube and social networks to make their stories more expression , to show their photos , to show their stories , to tell their own true stories .
at the same time we get them to come together and explore our part of the world .
so i got more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; well , maybe if i put those ants out there , they drag them up there . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do this ? &quot;
and as i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , rough appreciation , sometimes five , six or seven weeks , you cannot always anticipate .
and i rounded it all , and shaped from it into the <unk> .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very reactive work , but the best things come in small <unk> .
they expect by their employees they have asked them to do what they performed when they performed the assignment they can &apos;t do .
there is this absolute focus of being , this absolute pun of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute heart of compassion , and love that defines the primary properties of compassion .
my warmer body flew into a direction , my continued bicycle cycle in the other .
i put out all of the <unk> that i probably wouldn &apos;t have to do with them , the <unk> i won &apos;t ruin , the friends i didn &apos;t look at , the friends i couldn &apos;t look at , the <unk> i couldn &apos;t go with them .
because then you don &apos;t need the bills .
and if you look at them from behind , against the wind , you can just walk them over and make it <unk> in the filth . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had dropped my leg cut off , and there was a 15 percent chance of survival .
how i became more and more inhuman , and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds lighter than i am now .
and no one puts those modern <unk> in my eyes more than david black .
walk up , says , is the threshold of what human beings do .
he &apos;s president of the international coalition for <unk> , which is the least non-western name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three and months later , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so as soon as i try to get to the piano , i became a lot of <unk> .
and at the end , you &apos;ve been so short that things like the &quot; flight of the bumblebee &quot; wasn &apos;t a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t hate that .
they &apos;re still concerned about securing their own lifestyle in the world , in a world that &apos;s even clean , a world that is still not contaminated yet in a world that is not even more polluted .
we now know that they are capable of capable of doing that research , which is totally impossible when i started .
the long language of loving ones with the mother who evolved during those long childhood , and also the siblings , can remain enshrined for all life , and that can be taken up to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the giant camp <unk> in the woods , they need meat , and they get the pygmies blew up in the <unk> , and they &apos;ve lived there in their wonderful lives , as many of them have been lived for many years , <unk> .
yesterday , someone said someone .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are others in new york .
do you come and get me down here ?
there &apos;s the <unk> out there on the politicians ?
what we &apos;re going to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a few dozen different kinds of molecules -- there &apos;s a <unk> reduction in complexity , but yet to try to create something <unk> .
it &apos;s even very scary . once it forms , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
now , if you &apos;re all experts on objects , we &apos;re going to play with those protocells play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of this body out of <unk> , which we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blob in there represent these black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black sludge .
in his lab , martin <unk> , the experimental light of chemicals , the experimental light of chemicals that are acting like living cells , and his work shows how life appeared on earth first could be -- and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a <unk> <unk> to take your tadpole out for a walk .
what &apos;s the -- how did you know this ? you took it out .
but if we did it in every person -- everybody fire , we could <unk> the case .
it &apos;s actually the filth that goes out into her pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated with -- it &apos;s associated with -- -- it &apos;s being associated with -- -- it &apos;s associated with --
the birds couldn jumping from one to the other .
you can <unk> the latest news from him . you can talk with him .
but keeping those flock together , will require a great toll of our planet .
so , as we borrow the skin cells and multiply them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years now , starting with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that when we &apos;re doing it throughout the world we &apos;re doing , we see that there is almost a universal aspire to help people have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen sulfide .
this is creating a huge amount of energy to produce fresh energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , can also be others .
you needed to survive .
and we made sure we could be assigned to our school district and funding support and support support .
because why would our students get so far away from residence ?
it became a book , and then a show .
there had an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
on the west coast , they have destroyed her forest .
but on this picture , you see , as we started building the filter model , which soon became a big <unk> brazil .
now , when i was approaching the clock , my dream started to explore the <unk> field of <unk> .
if you look at the south <unk> , you can see the proportions of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are these <unk> sites of protected places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> sites needed sites .
maybe there &apos;s also a <unk> running there .
there &apos;s so much power to combine science and visualization together , that there are these kinds of imagery -- it &apos;s like both sides and seeing it is like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have in our society today a truly dramatic <unk> level .
so i don &apos;t have to go into that .
you &apos;re manipulating it , which is not supposed to remain .
that &apos;s a three-story building .
so one example that we all know is that the cell phone is . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and artistic way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of that allow us to do it .
seriously , they &apos;re clapping for -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you might think that it could be a big problem for a legislation , but it doesn &apos;t seem to make congress very powerfully .
but if you make a lot of qualitative math , it &apos;s not going to do it , and then it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we have done , we made out of things we &apos;ve found , and every single option we have found , and every single option of this industry in this industry .
this is the easy thing .
i had a very multicultural , <unk> , expensive training in india , and that has almost broke me .
and i thought , i &apos;d like to start a barefoot college -- college just for the poor .
a professional musician is somebody with a combination of competence , mentors and conviction .
and as i said , they said , &quot; do you show us what is possible . what do you do ?
the entire stream comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how to calculate your country , what you would do if you get arrested , what you would do if you get a sick animal .
get tension in there , reduce the presence of the schools , come down between teachers and parents , so the puppets of the teachers and the parents in front of the village , and say , &quot; give you your hands .
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , sir president . &quot;
a <unk> .
and our <unk> is one of the largest , dynamically interconnected computers of the world for these kinds of <unk> .
so you see here the <unk> <unk> along the <unk> of what we consider artists to be created for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data among these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
and i think it &apos;s physically , financially , emotionally , emotionally , and in almost every other way of doing so much better . &quot; i don &apos;t buy a minute .
he didn &apos;t say money , and , of course , robert <unk> six months later , the same idea .
in this case , because they were in the experiment that i used to report on them , prints from <unk> images .
we collect our materials , went out of the room , and waited half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
they scaled two images out , and they had two beautiful <unk> called <unk> <unk> of them , and we said , &quot; what would you say ? &quot;
we take a totally new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re going to give it a discount , and we can do it in two different ways .
<unk> , the big car and the <unk> legs are beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh , shit .
&quot; mama , don &apos;t look at it ! &quot;
not forget that this tradition isn &apos;t derived from <unk> , but continues back into a time before we populated stories on <unk> shirts , recording stories on <unk> <unk> .
the kinds of food , yeah .
the sort of <unk> roof , you know , you know .
and so , we flew my dad to his dad , because i knew him , he would kill me , if i dropped them alone , so we get into the car .
&quot; and i had this kind of blue uniform on a blue uniform and a pungent expression in the face ? &quot;
do i really want to go there ? because if i don &apos;t have <unk> cups , to get me out there -- enough metaphor for their taste ? -- could it be that i never come back again .
do you see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret intelligence agency .
she says , &quot; mom , you have to watch ! &quot;
&quot; i agree with the little old lady , <unk> , damn ! &quot;
she &apos;s gone up from the car . &quot;
i have really big fear .
so what is the social result ?
where can i go today and connect with anyone ?
and if we have it , we will decide about how many kilometers we drive , what we &apos;re going to live and work on , where we live and work .
so , smart terminal at the station , and you see exactly where your bus is right now , and when it comes from , you can buy your flight in real time .
i want to be the wireless mesh <unk> , and i &apos;m asking that this network of open standards for every way to be accessible is to each other .
and they popped up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness , you know what a challenge that might be .
i said i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three a point of view , and i wanted to leave them with a <unk> .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that grier is just a culturally authentic person , and therefore , it comes from the senate .
i ate <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in green <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that it turns out there &apos;s a problem .
i found it to speculate strange about it , as if it is a competition , about a kind of fresh wound .
it became largely a white , rich <unk> <unk> , who was not <unk> for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a <unk> .
people <unk> about two things -- they were stunned by the destruction , but there was also a sense of <unk> about the <unk> of the new yorker , which i found very emotional .
because , by looking at four platforms along the <unk> -- which is an <unk> version of a <unk> -- we knew that it had to be flexible to be able to <unk> in terms of <unk> conditions , and the transformed definition of ground zero toward ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking of cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know children will suffer every year every year .
if , in heaven forbid -- god forbid -- somebody from us here and a concussion <unk> , probably most of us ended up in a period of several hours up to a couple of weeks .
you &apos;ve got to deal with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom was able to see that a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 store .
it &apos;s not true , but it &apos;s happening tony blair in in 2004 when his doodle was , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was described to it .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of the visual language that happens in <unk> sequence .
he told him that there were no cure .
today , all countries are obliged to offer patents to medicines who have been at least 20 years old .
it comes off from the drug companies to run their patents and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> . people used to sit in the sun at the beginning of the sun , in the afternoon , very high humidity and they felt not .
they can fit everything to worry about their well-being .
he has all these services , <unk> , <unk> tickets and so small things you &apos;re doing right now , but for people that connects it to the digital world .
and the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher from this teacher ? &quot;
let &apos;s see what he does . &quot;
and the husband of his daughter , he was also mad through the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
now , <unk> had a ct scan of our studies .
now when we feel emotion , we show them .
and you might get the idea that the unhappy people should take a different structural role within the network .
this is my favorite muse . &quot;
they &apos;re both made out of carbon , and yet , one of these things has been put in place on a particular way , on the left , and they get <unk> , which is soft and dark .
to put this stuff up , let me go out for a moment .
and eventually , they &apos;re not going to be easy .
under the same circumstances , older people take their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more important to positive information than on the negatives .
we cost life out of life .
they &apos;d like me : &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to put this date on for this girl on this bar mitzvah party on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so i said , honestly , often , often don &apos;t know , what happens when i dance .
they were clinging to me and uncles and uncle over a period of five years old .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie treaty certainly has doubled the rights of the nation and the <unk> of lakota hills across the sacred black hills .
and the treaty of fort laramie treaty said that at least three quarters of the world must be sign by the country .
they were tired of ghost dances .
the <unk> is eight times higher in the american average .
so what &apos;s left ?
and today , child mortality dropped dropped since 1960 by 1960 by 24 percent .
you can get it as a pill or as a needle , you have to take it every day , you need to use it every day .
if we like , how do we have people to do with people ?
but basically , it makes a lot of meaning .
so , she says , are they smarter than a <unk> ?
so bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is this car , it looks safely .
now you &apos;ll think , &quot; if my life depended on it , i would naturally use it every day . &quot;
we need to combine those with a scientific method .
this is something other than actually did an effective campaign .
which is nothing new .
light will be darker .
we &apos;re doing it for our customers .
we &apos;ve seen that in the sun .
now , logic , logic , look at logical , ok now , you can get from this wrist into this wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . if every one -- another person -- one other person -- couldn &apos;t always be the same answers .
so , now , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some <unk> .
here i have to start looking at from the beginning of looking at my maps as the <unk> -- oh , we should begin to begin with -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what is i going to use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you can see your hand .
moment , right now , take any card .
another suit . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
there are all cards blocked -- there are all maps maps -- are true to me ?
and last , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of them seemed to know this kid .
after i got back , i did my whole company on a <unk> company . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t hear a song , you could not turn off in the car .
let &apos;s see what this really happens here .
i always say , &quot; i always say , &quot; if you have a dot-com , you can always see one eyebrow , and then everybody sees it . &quot;

so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this stuff .
if you &apos;re the fastest of everyone today , you get 20 bucks . &quot;
however , in the tasks of the 21st century , but it doesn &apos;t work -- often does not work , often does not work and often do damage .
think about your own work .
the standard quality is lower .
these are the building blocks of an entirely new <unk> for our businesses .
this is a day of intense autonomy led to a whole series of <unk> that might never have existed .
do it because you like to make it .
the aluminum is used due to its slight weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , they were contracting , in size , every globe and their gold <unk> , to these little <unk> of these small earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , shows the other direction .
so this has evolved in many ways in many ways .
the <unk> on the object would probably be a very highly accurate picture of the earth .
but they &apos;re always shutting down the 10 percent of the way that they &apos;re most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a club at <unk> <unk> dollars .
so , nonprofit organizations must have to help herself , feisty , large , big adventures , to try to get out of fear that &apos;s going to get your call through the mud .

the overhead went right now .
dan <unk> : our thoughts about charity

that &apos;s what he does .

kleiber is about the process .
so as <unk> , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are philip suicides worldwide , nations worldwide .
and in the midst of climate change , it is not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes really joy joy .
they &apos;re thinking about it if they &apos;re going to keep it moving forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition <unk> , we would have to invent the entire community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and up to a degree centigrade exactly the games they &apos;re playing with , to hide the issue so powerfully , that you can &apos;t see what the actual performance challenges are .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states who disagree with this big challenge .
and even if they were living in the same way , they could lease there .
it &apos;s meant to be more like private accounting .
but i had a cookout when i was approaching <unk> <unk> , and i was in my life <unk> in my life , and i was trying to choose between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady boy i knew that sex might be because of the five senses .
the dedication i &apos;m dealing with is good sex with all extreme senses in an extreme level level .
of course , the five senses isn &apos;t the only thing to make life interesting .
we &apos;re born with everyone as artists .
if you have entertainment , you have to come up with the next answer to <unk> what it has started .
but your parents tell them , &quot; it will bounce everything off the waves . &quot;
but kids do usually work out of art . it &apos;s playing .
but as a teacher , you find a <unk> .
in <unk> , there &apos;s always people who sing &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; hotel california &quot; while they &apos;re <unk> .
right in this minute , we can shut the television off , turn the television off , stand out on the internet , stand up and start to do something .
the students fall in a kind kind of trance .
he said it was his profile , &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said . &quot; actors , he said .
let me start with what i came up with at that point .
it will give stronger storms and more floods .
if , in the future , there will be an warming in the future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
and the economic response is almost unthinkable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if now a car accident happens , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t just gain the guy , but the crew .
for something else used to be used , used to use everything you had .
but today we &apos;re going to use a <unk> machine .
more , it &apos;s not .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> from the united atmosphere has done something extremely incredible .
one of the problems at that level , if you &apos;re going to go down to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you &apos;re going to go into 10,000 <unk> , you can actually use oxygen .
and they &apos;ve created a puppet for him , he &apos;s exactly what he looked like .
we expect and others expect to say that perhaps the faa or the <unk> is going to be saying , &quot; you must put someone in a suit that is disconnected from the airplane . &quot;
there were three main elements -- not true ? they traveled through the conference , which is important for what i want to talk about .
and the girl said , &quot; you know it . &quot;
the problem is an artist as you grow up , and i &apos;m now convinced that we don &apos;t grow into creativity in creativity , but we &apos;re going to become more <unk> .
anywhere in the world .
the entire system was invented -- anywhere in the world , there was no public education system in front of the 19th century .
the brain is not divided into abstract .
they took credit cards , they took jazz and jazz , they were dancing modernism and contemporary entertainment .
so , the festival is going to run like a very good deal with a <unk> press that you would die .
let &apos;s just say value for <unk> &apos; value .
there is a hand for me like one hand that wants everyone to bring things to the <unk> of things .
before i go back into the middle east , i &apos;d like to conclude with a quote from one of the largest <unk> in the middle east .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
so you &apos;re beautiful , you &apos;re limitations of behavior , and you &apos;re disorders of the spirit .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we need to be looking for in particular , to be able to get there to be able to get there before the very different behavior .
how do you scale it ? &quot;
and the three are all right , though they &apos;re all right in different context , and one of them is magically <unk> , and they &apos;re kind of like doing those books , because they have something very special about themselves , they have something very special about themselves .
the kids taught them to do it .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that content is important .
i was transformed by my children .
howard &apos;s doing this experiment , and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and finally he sees that doesn &apos;t come out of beauty .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with obsessed .
howard doesn &apos;t believe it existed at all .
these people always say when you ask them how they feel their coffee .
a lot of elegance and culture and culture and meaning .
so it was . and why did we like this ?
he was traded for a bunch of gifts , and spent the bulk of his career in lower <unk> , and then finally fell in . he became the general manager of oakland &apos;s .
we all know what happened when there was millions of women over tens of millions of years from tens of millions of years of history , until we got a huge study , <unk> from the center of the center , found out of the national disease .
thank you .
but , <unk> <unk> , he didn &apos;t want us to do it .
but there &apos;s also a gray gap in between .
these are four really different kinds of ways to see the world . i named them .
what &apos;s interesting is , as you go through it -- and by the way -- this is from <unk> -- you &apos;re looking at these artifacts from modern comics : <unk> fey &apos;s simple line line drawing and a <unk> from links to the right .
and that was what i could : perhaps , perhaps comics could make comics on an endless canvas on an endless canvas on pbs and in the name and in <unk> .
this is from daniel libeskind <unk> <unk> in britain .
and perhaps all of you knew this as a long time ago , but for me , as i walked up with this very difficult thing , i &apos;d never seen that the <unk> challenge was never seen as <unk> .
and that &apos;s honestly and true , and the reason , because this is what <unk> demonstrates like this creates a sustainable impressions .
if you think your baby is , your baby was gay , lesbian , you better give it to the adoption .
<unk> political solution , the citizen of texas <unk> , was to pray for rainfall .
this song is called &quot; <unk> <unk> the sun . &quot;

they popped up shortly after the dinosaurs , from 65 million years ago , when whales were still legs , they took a discount of caloric <unk> <unk> , and they give me these <unk> <unk> .
and how do you do this ?
and the <unk> <unk> takes the molas when they come into the bay , they get the fins , turns it into some kind of <unk> , and then they put it into a kind of <unk> , and then <unk> it .
let me show you the latest data data .
and it was the most exciting that everybody was interested in and their interested in the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a high-powered <unk> .
this is something you don &apos;t hear every day .
<unk> <unk> .
australia , it &apos;s usually the <unk> of <unk> who are in prison .
she talked about it , and he <unk> the first <unk> thing about what we call the <unk> .
because no one &apos;s going to get a reductionist .
so why don &apos;t we do something about this problem in real life ?
goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last step ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! that is not possible . &quot;
you could cope with the <unk> with the <unk> .
so von neumann , a <unk> , and a mathematician from the armed they took everything together . they needed a room to build them .
and they &apos;re working on top of it , first of all , worked by <unk> .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally , they discovered it was a hallucination .
i know if i need to get beat myself . &quot;
he &apos;s going to run the machine all night . if anyone remembers stephen wolfram , he did all of this .
now , 50 years later , we &apos;re going to sit there -- it &apos;s kind of irrelevant <unk> animation .
sadly , for the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about , four americans that are still alive , four americans who are still alive , die of their food .
this is a global issue .
<unk> city .
and he &apos;s got a snout of them . he &apos;s sorry , his friends , his family and his community .
they want -- they want to control themselves .
you know that for a long period , a long period of time stayed with this tight understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most children get them .
well , convenience retail .
if you can cook , doesn &apos;t play a role .
there are lots of wonderful things going on in front of america now if we just look back backwards now .
misha glenny : embrace anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a ingenious group <unk> <unk> <unk> by 2011 .
so the net connects everything , and will very soon as soon as a lot of human activities .
interestingly , anonymous anonymous uses his information company , but not for profit profit .
he was designing in 2003 and in 2004 , like he went on in new york on tour , took 10,000 dollars out of the atms here , 30,000 dollars from the atms in 2003 he used to use <unk> credit cards .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and <unk> middle family , his obsession with play as a teenager led him to <unk> .
and most , by the exception of script and <unk> , they didn &apos;t really have the real social skills in the outside world -- except in the net .
i think there are several reasons . i won &apos;t go into the details , but some of them .
but they &apos;re all free from the market , and what the market is , especially one is the big demographic .
so we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples to dead big boxes that have been added into all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , as many libraries , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be obtained by the <unk> of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it has helped to motivate that eight of 13 dialect in <unk> plans in <unk> plans to be <unk> .
the stream was added up from the window into the space .
so their inhabitants are typical as being typical , but they &apos;re less vulnerable than towns .
&quot; look at his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; look at his vagina . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t really start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way it exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real importance , our bodies of our heads -- that these separation separation has created a division that is also disconnected from the possibility of choosing .
i want to talk about this little story about my own beginnings , because it is strong with our luck and with agnes .
perhaps it &apos;s on my <unk> south carolina , which is not a lot smaller than it is today , and once from a future as a self-sufficient country .
well , perhaps he was too <unk> , because he stayed where he was , he stayed long afterwards after the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> started in budapest .
and he received the same answer : &quot; bring me to the best workers you can find , and if they &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll ask them . &quot;
and as clear as it says , it says , &quot; it &apos;s ok . it was so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; dr. robicsek , dr. robicsek said , &quot; i walked out of the movie . &quot;
as said , he said too much too much .
and you can imagine them right now .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most difficult cases , and we <unk> the other for the next day .
so , we came up with these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother , during the period of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s no longer , you &apos;re doing it as long as you go further .
what i want to try to try -- i hope to highlight the brain points .
and what i &apos;d like to point later on in the slide is 50 percent of u.s. decline under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> , because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles per se .
and so , we went along the <unk> area in an area adjacent to the <unk> , and we found the missing heat .
so i started developing a new <unk> of design with a kind of <unk> that i started with , and i don &apos;t have to step into my vehicle .
we &apos;ll find the chief minister of <unk> .
and i looked at her yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would like to let a kid with no driver &apos;s talk about my health system .
in some parts of the world , in south africa , for example , in south africa , it &apos;s just very hard accessible .
when we saw the effects of <unk> , andrew , and i decided we had to scale it up so many people as possible as possible education .
what was the particular part of these courses ?
the video will cut every few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities , that multiple investors don &apos;t have a bad thing .
so , you can ask yourself at a particular courses , which is the highest <unk> and how you can help students to fix those students .
we actually see the beginning of either through them through a personalized <unk> , or by <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and about what my first thought was what was called &quot; infinite &quot; when i was still a kid .
and of course , in our society , naturally about being the reality of others .
i have so my doubt about the value of newton &apos;s genius science . like , for example , it &apos;s been rational to be rational in a <unk> .
so you can see my surprise when i got to read in &quot; the new yorker &quot; in &quot; the new yorker , chief of the <unk> department , &quot; said , &quot; <unk> rand , &quot; <unk> rand .
i think you can make fun of the kind of fun ones and not about the ones that don &apos;t have . exactly from the reason i don &apos;t have a joke about tapestries , and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;m really careful about this ancient times of the <unk> dynasty , i &apos;ll tell you .
he said , i have to give him more respect for it , because it can take for 18 years to get a really good <unk> .
huh ? yeah ? what ? i don &apos;t have to hear them . &quot;
and i fear that <unk> someone don &apos;t like us .
i think about beauty , i think about beauty , trying to think about beauty , because there in his book , he says that name can sometimes make beauty .
george w. bush , which costs our security , and we have to pay the cost of our freedom , we must pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , there &apos;s no chance on the globe about the idea -- well , perhaps , very few years ago -- that there are a few organisms that exists outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly about trying to go wrong with a particle collider and a response reaction that was destroyed the world .
we have to do with biotechnology at the same time in <unk> .
of course , we don &apos;t want to see that .
what can we do about them ?
and now the worst part .
we spend a lot of money on trying to make sure that we don &apos;t die in a <unk> system , but we spend almost nothing on it . and yet , it &apos;s totally preventable .
we don &apos;t want to go back again on the <unk> .
i hope that will happen .
this is very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> , from which life on the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only known about it recently .
and this is what the system <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , represented in those circles .
anybody who comes out afterwards grabs just reaches into the database , can access the information that is needed for everything that is going to happen .
we &apos;re going to be able to ride the wave , the technology possibilities .
in an earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes we never saw before , go out of the sea floor .
<unk> john <unk> demonstrates a network of unfinished cameras and sensors that make our oceans for global , interactive lab -- and capillary adhesion into the world &apos;s atmosphere .
that &apos;s why i believe that optimism is shifting architecture forward .
again , radical against conservative .
and the <unk> thing about the obvious . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; it is thinner than unexpected , always will be unexpected .
but i &apos;d prefer to play something completely unfamiliar , and even by error , instead of doing the same time that it &apos;s hollowed out from his insignificance .
take a lot of rooms from rooms that were never going to be a big town in a big city .
there are victims of the victims .
daniel libeskind is very big ideas . he calls 17 terms of his vision on his vision -- raw , <unk> , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative effort .
it has also the smallest <unk> of all the cars of this size .
i &apos;m really excited about it , or will there just be few <unk> ?
em : it &apos;s just got to be simple . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and on top of that capital , you &apos;ll put on top of your roof and put your roof on top of the roof , and then calculated the <unk> or a <unk> <unk> that is lower than the electricity station .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve got to go through it in 2008 .
it &apos;s kind of like a jet jet propulsion .
so how to use everything in the world could be a person ?
look at this .
boy , when you <unk> our livestock , and you see a nollywood reaction , as he eats one of our goats , he is very nervous . then go to him .
we suffered suffered starvation .
and our tradition looks like this : in every tradition , there &apos;s a holy fire .
up until now , we were able to fund the world of wildlife conservation in the world , the very small parts of the world .
and also very important -- we invest the money in the enlightenment of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- again , <unk> <unk> among many in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding behind these cost behind huge gains .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> lead passionate about the revolution revolution for <unk> food revolution .
<unk> , orlando , florida , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
it &apos;s like a <unk> of protein .
science is seeing the world through the psyche , politicians , things are measured , and they can be described , but they can build a frame of knowledge and insight .
from the idea of a bunch of cameras , after three weeks became a plan for 25 weeks .
this is the natural cycle .
that wouldn &apos;t usually do a psychologist photographer a photograph , a photograph that is true ? but sometimes it has to do to represent the dimensions .
here you see what the glacier &apos;s going back backwards .
so there &apos;s several cameras here .
could india be the source of innovation or a global heart of innovation , just like it &apos;s become a cultural heart for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we asked people in conversations with these people , they said , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t get a professor , if you &apos;re not too graduate .
the best hospitals in the doctors would go for cancer and births with births , <unk> , heart disease , for synthetic <unk> , <unk> at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
it &apos;s kind of like a little bit like -- this is a recent morning for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i realize i recognize a coded note when i see one .
everybody in our society comes with cancer -- if not personal , then by one beloved people , family member , a friend of mine , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , inside of a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields in the lab over 20 different cancers , and we see this effect on all of them .
he got the <unk> <unk> .
but what we can see is that in sixth month , the sixth of the tumor , and it starts <unk> .
it &apos;s only the beginning .
this is a new cubicle , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rain from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their backs .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles caesar , it looks like this .
there &apos;s a bach like a bach or a <unk> through that scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english we have <unk> and <unk> .
and you have to keep even more repressive .
these are the beautiful stairs that we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> , by 27 percent dropped by 27 percent per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent from india .
they will get into the jobs in textiles , bringing people from the <unk> jobs and bring them into the direction towards the industrial and wealth .
and the countries on the right , there &apos;s the <unk> , and basically , every country with a <unk> host of , say , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , we &apos;re talking about three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t get that right .
buy african products .
but i think a lot bigger problem in it is that this logic -- that we should put ipods and not bombs to drop -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas <unk> &apos;s new book .
so there &apos;s 500 people right now and four of them have been selected to go to the institution , and they have selected them to go to it .
now , by joining people in the planning till 2020 , isn &apos;t necessarily going to change anything about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : drives the internet serious serious expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was hanging around with us younger guys .
because , for me , who lived in this time and lived in this period , was the question : &quot; do you want to be either sex or drug or drug -- and we didn &apos;t use drugs .
i was like paralyzed , guys .
as indians , and now politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about the most <unk> , which is our country , worried about india as a new <unk> , but even the new superpower .
in other words , with other words , we have all kinds of <unk> stories about countries , regardless of whether they want to come in the daytime or not .
because of the lightning bolt in our country , pretty slow down , it took about half an hour to get a call out of it .
she cannot understand the dialogue .
so , this can sometimes have unintended consequences . ok .
and those of you who have a lot of <unk> here , like surprised to see how many <unk> there are at the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> , which is going to explain the <unk> .
i went home and i did a little bit of a bit , and i found some startling statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
well , the title , this phrase , comes from a reviewer , an early reviewer , and this is one passage i just love , and i would like to read them .
and this is a good thing , because if it would be like this , mother nature would have a problem : how do we get chimps to mate ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , which is obviously not obvious , and therefore i picked it up for the end .
alright ? stop . so it goes .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but no , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually think that probably probably knows many , many reasons why we need new things to suggest , really , very fast .
it looks like this . you want to see something like this .
bob mckim has another very -- another version of this practice made in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we learned from time : you can get a lot better in advance , much more creative results , if you think about the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design for about a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to that .
you know what it felt like , all of this insecurity , as long as you go back in corridor , as the doctors worry about a <unk> basket case , and you wonder what &apos;s going on here .
so , by that , we &apos;d feel everyone safely , and we would have a good time because we deal with rules and agreed .
we &apos;re doing everything leads to success , but then when we &apos;re there , we believe we &apos;ve done it , and we &apos;re gonna sit back and do all those things we &apos;ve done .
i was faster , but as depressed as well .
and i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the <unk> is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; i hope forever , the last time in public .
he made sure everything together .
it took an 900 people participate in it .
and the second thing is that people are obviously experiencing an actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal security democracies , the society , the state of us , not just determine our own selves , but he also demands it from us .
it means that we will fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions i wanted to ask you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are coming to use when they &apos;re creating something ?
and so i said , and my fellow , as well as my fellow , likes to say that there must be better ways to do it .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one fall in the fall .
he <unk> them into the right position , <unk> them with his nose and beating .
we experienced the first surprise .
there had to be allowed to be some kind of <unk> to create the amount of force and the speed we observe and the <unk> of the system .
a load cell measures , and this is actually a <unk> load cell phone with a crystal in interior .
this is the <unk> beetle -- there &apos;s the heel , and this is going to hitting the load cell , hitting the load cell .
a very , very difficult solution to this problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not a planet , <unk> , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most beautiful classical <unk> that we &apos;ve ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who just benefit from this , that this is a three-dimensional space .
now look at it -- he just lets me stand up .
the submersible that ran out last year was this one .
so <unk> is understanding architecture as <unk> , <unk> , -- sorry for the apparent example -- is not the right way to choose that we need to choose .
basically , new york on the backs of <unk> has been built , our roads across their shells .
in this eight <unk> chambers , small <unk> chambers , they &apos;re basically going to be <unk> .
so , you walked around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
eventually , snow created a landscape of outbreak .
and this is what happens every week .
i did her beck at the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon , it was discovered oil .
the other side of the field is <unk> <unk> , where is actually supposed to stop osama bin laden . that &apos;s <unk> .
that was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me go now and look at the hubble <unk> &apos;s deep field .
but then , you go to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes long . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of the universe in which it comes from the universe of the universe .
we have only one million galaxies .
so , the stuff that exists in the picture is dark matter , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you haven &apos;t seen a lot of it in it .
this simulation was done with 1,000 processors a month , just to make this visible .
with <unk> , we hope we &apos;ll have a resolution , which is about this image of the earth that you can actually see the complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the process , we &apos;re actually getting stressed .
47 percent .
and that &apos;s crazy . that &apos;s what we do all the time , even in the lives .
i got into a vicious cycle , which ran too much pain and <unk> with the pads , so i could keep almost nothing .
so i asked myself , could you be creative , if you &apos;re looking for trying to look for the limitations ?
this didn &apos;t happen from us today to tomorrow .
and the <unk> is done by <unk> , as well as a <unk> <unk> . there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
stalin <unk> dropped out of the 30s , snipers , killing millions of polygons . in the 40s they saw themselves the nazis , the <unk> , were burned . many of the women then became exploited to germany .
it receives the pain to cope with . &quot;
and as a footnote historian , i became excited about the idea of what we learned in the virtual world about us , and beyond our identity , to be able to use a better life in the real world .
we get used to be a new way to be ourselves alone .
human relationships are fine , messy and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because in the moment where people are alone , even for a couple seconds , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they get panic , they get access to the electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the converse is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we hadn &apos;t won &apos;t won the <unk> , which some of our sons were predicted , and rather often -- quite often , i felt that they were paying their predictions on some basic kind of <unk> .
perhaps because of my father at night , my dad has always read friends .
so i left them with it in quiet -- but <unk> and <unk> you had to be .
and finally , i thought i had a pyramid pyramid , but i &apos;m missing in time to go into it .
even though you lose , no fear of failure in failure , when we &apos;ve given <unk> everything , because who can give people more desire than anything he can do .
if i &apos;m going to call the name , i never know an answer .
do i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be obtained cells .
now in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month we &apos;ve done with this technology , the creation of human rights technology .
and then we can map them map to map 360 degrees , and we can look at the kidney in all their material properties , and then we can take that information simply and then print it by printing .
i couldn &apos;t routinely go into high school . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said something like , &quot; yes , i want to . i want this operation .
you might have noticed that there is a new area called <unk> called <unk> .
and connected with these <unk> , there were examples from the world -- from the choice of a president to <unk> wikipedia , and everything in between -- who allowed to determine the power of a lot .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what they need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want the music to play .
my name is joseph and a member of kenya in kenya .
we have to recognize our women and children , we have to run race . &quot;
i try to improve the infrastructure .
late at night , i went home with batteries and ice cream .
philip zimbardo : anyone <unk> ?
co : i decided to remain in the country , giving up a masters in moscow , and working on trying to make this happen .
that can be large spending , but if the city can generate a number of x volunteers for y , they can extract the <unk> manual of the city .
they have <unk> , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes that were interrogated for me to talk about here , between two- and <unk> people who are going to be able to go into the towns .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> steeped in mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ve got political activities once you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technology revolution that will make this dream true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same <unk> , as i did , helped me with her engaged support , <unk> qualifications in law .
at the time , <unk> <unk> was working with a <unk> processor , but he used to develop a machine called <unk> and <unk> , he could develop a machine that was able to read every compass .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to me to read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport those books across the border , in the different english countries , different versions of china , united states , canada , australia , australia , and new zealand had to have all kinds of <unk> from harry potter .
the <unk> . lifespan has more than doubled , and it has been increasing by a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you want people like me to be lucky , ok ?
secondly , the new class is a pretty good news because , as soon as we do , we don &apos;t have to do those anymore , and we don &apos;t have to do it , and we have <unk> and <unk> .
the societal challenges because of those inequality should be vulnerable .
the commercial game is surprisingly clear , and surprising straightforward , especially straightforward .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with literate technology , integrated into something more democratic society and being supported by an economy that promote inequality instead of possibilities .
in the course of the years , i started feeling more powerless than that idea of god .
and some of them have figured out that we can only believe in a god , which is our pain .
the line comes in the line , line &apos; wind and waves obey him obey him .
so , who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
by seeking the god &apos;s god , by seeking my own <unk> <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the history of technology technology .
we haven &apos;t yet found eruptions that older than 40 years old , and the average age of these fisheries and gatherers tribes is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our body has used to integrate this new diet with these new food .
so , this equality of the energy and matter , which is also showing , and also the modern science of <unk> demonstrates , entropy and information , and matter and energy together are linked together , so that there &apos;s a very long continuum .
this is a robot wants to put your plug plug into plug into more power .
and what i mean by that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
so a great evolution that began billions of years ago , moves through us and continues , and our choice is kind of in technology , is really showing us with that force , which is a lot more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classrooms <unk> 30 to 40 students .
and we put it all down , and found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bar , <unk> bar , and it had to look like somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the ship &apos;s hull . &quot;
so we waited , we sat around the table and we waited on the table .
there are lots of <unk> , and the only problem , especially for those adults who worked in <unk> , who didn &apos;t know anything they knew were just a toilet .
the teachers who work with us -- everything is different from teachers -- they tell us what to do .
about 170 bucks you &apos;ve worked with them in the book , and so this has worked wonderful .
and right behind the -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- immediately they saw as children were taught .
there are also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see , but it &apos;s opening up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he joins his cousin .
he &apos;s going to tell him an email , he &apos;s going to answer every question you can think of .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that says that peace represents the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s one side that says that peace is the beginning of schools and services .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one of the manual &apos; manual &apos; manual &apos; manual &apos; manual , did they know ?
on the other hand , there are <unk> streets , and we &apos;re all driving here .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you .
and he said , basically , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i have always felt hard about that .
so i met this kind of complications .
i found that there are also very good for these magnets to be very good .
college is most difficult , so number 10 difficult .
from everything in the weird <unk> device about <unk> , who has been a window on up to the moment in front of the moment in front of my house , dark <unk> there were <unk> <unk> there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great illustrations of karen armstrong to remind , that religion really understood nothing to do with behavior behavior .
the <unk> has seen , wider , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it has exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> of an area that &apos;s about the size of its state in arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> who used australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
there &apos;s a new appreciation of the <unk> that we have in reasoning with the consideration of this challenge .
before i show you a bunch of images about <unk> , i &apos;d like to point out of this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
so , this is really an extraordinary school in this regard .
we &apos;ve done this morning with keith <unk> , who , many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their lectures , from fear to be seen as stupid <unk> .
here &apos;s the example that you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that allows us to think about what robots for us mean .
no . so , i had to think a little bit sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask ourselves as a physicist .
we can push it up , and the forces split more . there are more of them , but they are weaker .
&quot; <unk> seven . &quot;
and there are lots of employees in foundations who call this &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the idea of the justice , which gives us our lives and gives us a sense of what is right in life , which is what we should do , which is what we should do , social justice .
and like that , he <unk> himself during the <unk> .
so every week , the <unk> would come round . &apos; &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom of a tumor , one infection , one inflammation or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed , paralyzed -- <unk> like that .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- who , frankly , is not very effective in this kind of pain .
now , you get a sense of how a lot of rock we &apos;re talking about here is how much rock we &apos;re talking here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s nothing . so i can live with it .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him from the hind line of view , and these are just stars .
in 2004 , nasa launched a probe called &quot; deep impact , &quot; which one -- who took a part of a comet into the essence of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between dinosaurs and us is that we can have a <unk> and we can change our future .
and at that time i led to <unk> , the only independent to be precise , the only electronic medium in the country .
and i thought <unk> would survive and be a great company when <unk> first had gone out , what turns out to be the right thing .
and at the end of the day he says , look , it won &apos;t work , you &apos;ll never see your money again , but my foundation will lay down 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test your idea .
and we said , well , that &apos;s ok , let &apos;s meet , you know , you get into your business plan , what they actually did .
look , we started in east asia and <unk> with our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened up a <unk> tree .
and we &apos;ve created the idea , to spend religions on the free press .
and in that way , you organize the funding , so that there &apos;s no no blind , no blind people running around trying to find themselves .
so , why does this work ? this is the question .
well , some of them call a theory of everything .
one simple example is : newton found the law of gravity , which works like one divided through the square of the <unk> between the other <unk> objects .
the more folds you have , the better you ask the simplicity and elegance the theory .
one thing he thought was probably most of us today , but at his time , hadn &apos;t been overstated .
it doesn &apos;t really matter to the importance of knowing that they follow laws laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
from that ambition , he went back into the <unk> <unk> .
but when he was right now to launch his signature , his hand was deaf , his hand was deaf and destroyed by the morning thousand hands on the morning .
not very surprising -- they were just three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more , i understand what was incredible as an incredible privilege of being spent with this guy .
and as lincoln told the story , everyone went after the war after britain .
i asked my father of tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always going to be appreciative of these weird love for the story , which allows me to spend a life in back beyond the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
this is the <unk> , and this object is the evidence of life in exile , according to the entire years that they had seen in babylon , and in the memory of jerusalem , they could remind me that these jews were going to go home .
all of these are being respected .
the <unk> cylinder is from the <unk> of the great <unk> of <unk> , marduk , written .
you all know what happened .
in order to see this object in tehran , thousands of thousands of oiled jews were born to tehran .
some of them know about the <unk> of their lives , but they still think they &apos;re a <unk> evil .
the <unk> month-olds cried in the first few hours , but they had not meet meetings , and eventually they didn &apos;t learn more . they were <unk> , and they were going to start off in the air , in less days , and they start off in the air , like everyone else .
one study indicates that <unk> 10 percent of a cost cost whereas <unk> costs about 30 percent .
and this fascinated me , because i had spent almost my whole life in front of a camera .
you know , you know pretty fast what you have to do to get a answer .
it was <unk> people there -- most of them friends and family .
we heard everybody listened to each one .
but , of course , never arrived . it never occurred .
and after many , many meetings , i was ecstatic that this man , <unk> <unk> , actually one of my mentors mentors , mentors , has been able to bring unicef into the boat .
so he said yes , and we saw ourselves again in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and in his ways , etc , and , etc . , and they made it a reality .
so we connect ourselves with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about your credit card companies to deal with business .
the largest brain in the world should also be cognitively able too .
i <unk> the literature after the field of this number , but i could never find it .
it &apos;s just a big fibroid .
and amazingly , it &apos;s exactly what our ancestors have invented a million million years ago when they discovered cooking cooking .
rather simple approaches to the <unk> conversations that i performed .
and i think i &apos;m standing here at the beginning .
but as soon as the struggles were shifting , the physical rehabilitation was to undergo the physical rehabilitation .
behind him was a child , his son , red in his face effort , wanted to raise his father .
but , you know , anger and his son were already there .
at the evening , i was talking about my bosses &apos; bosses in the headquarters and i told them -- i said , &quot; look , i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting a few hours a day , just for some redesigning . &quot;
two member of the <unk> began to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not only in the middle of the center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a <unk> period .
and this hospital would have been able to afford <unk> .
why ? because the way i took it , was banned .
but what i learned was something deeper than that , namely , that leaders -- the manager of the economy -- incredibly bad decisions that made our economy right in front of the collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children and their children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to make the experience i had at swarthmore to africa .
my time is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which a great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s very much like the <unk> yellow ball -- the sun we describe as a children .
in fact , that &apos;s about half of them , more than half , are not going to be familiar .
32 lightning bolt <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , arguably . &quot;
and these are the messages they convey to them ?
because , in effect , the sponsor loved businesses , and so he keeps them on tv .
a professional <unk> that speaks to dead people , doesn &apos;t reach me ?
what is <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to get people out of what they call <unk> , <unk> and community meetings so they could do something about it .
thank you .
and so the entire hospital is often running over a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but what the user can control is whether it &apos;s just electricity or not , because they can control the <unk> on the basis of how much percent oxygen they put on your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device we can give hospitals to hospitals .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society of <unk> in <unk> .
anyway , by 1998 , as a filmmaker named john <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> b.c.
almost one fifth of greenhouse gases emissions comes from co2 -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like , like , animals , and i like to make sense of carbon dioxide and make animals flow on the line like the tools , not just that way .
<unk> was a <unk> in french .
one image of sculptors would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t really bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would argue that perhaps not too bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; why am i , though , though i know what i know , i don &apos;t know ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can do a painting with an iphone , and you can get all the name , even though it does sometimes make mistakes .
it &apos;s got <unk> . he finally won the race .
you can &apos;t see it , because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it &apos;s been from an interest to figure out more about it when the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very scary area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
human nature must have changed .
but a part of the reason -- and this is the reason why we have a ethical level of view -- is it also intrinsically valuable .
it might be more complicated in human beings , but perhaps not very much .
jh : is it <unk> to play with those forces ?
and so i knew i needed something that i needed for remote control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that they can be <unk> .
this is a great studio studio in the studio .
we take the pizza , our very first pizza , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the single slices of the hallway in the hallway and <unk> us .
i was sure of 20 , before i first went into an art museum .
i thought i &apos;d like , ok , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you &apos;re going to pick the works .
it &apos;s not a photoshop work .
they &apos;d been interested in creating a novel , <unk> <unk> , and they needed money for themselves , so they decided to do some interesting interesting projects .
this project is called &quot; fingertips . &quot;
and so , we went to the grave , and we did this , which was hilarious -- the attention that we got .
and it describes like the <unk> -- everything you say is like vegetable fruit with the <unk> fruit .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s based on origami . so here .
people used to use mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles .
or they &apos;re pushing it on top , and 50 stars on a flag with 13 bars in a flag with 13 bars .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve figured out these rules with which one puts them out of circles , weighing the evenly obey curves obey the curves , the extra rules obey obey gravity . that makes the folds .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to make it larger , you might need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going into space or whether you &apos;re going into a body .
i grew up in limpopo in the state of washington with a lot more free time on the state of washington .
we have only three minutes , but we talk about it for a long time .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to talk about it because if we don &apos;t recognize it , it will be very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the year -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women begin to begin to lease , and they &apos;re going to go on to today .
they gave instruction up from the top .
because i &apos;m writing about all this book , i &apos;m still greeted , and therefore no answer is no answer .
and it was very disheartening for her very disheartening .
because we haven &apos;t discovered this information yet , they come back to us in the form of pop culture , in this weird and <unk> way , where you can see that <unk> change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who sits in the middle , and there &apos;s the cable up there .
where the personal income is delivered on a scale that was delivered in inflation , in that time , more than doubles , has almost tripled .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you need 60 bits per second .
so , in the last book of me , i interviewed myself in the last book of &quot; good business , &quot; which has been interviewed from their environment as very successful and very ethical social responsibility .
so control is always a safe thing , because you &apos;re comfortable in it , but you &apos;re not really being turned on .
&quot; where are you born , grew and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own importance of what home is , and they had their importance for community , and even <unk> , which was associated with them from birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond that .
more and more people are born in the future or present in the future , as in the past .
i went down into the room i was going to sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in industrialized countries and two billion in developing countries .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by combining , using technology , technology <unk> .
the children &apos;s survival is the new green .
and again , they were better than we were : &quot; your brits and your mortality rate of heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but when you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the numbers of heart heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , and i started working with <unk> , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice who couldn &apos;t make the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be equally as well on the equator as well as the equator .
certainly many advances , many <unk> lives , many <unk> lives .
and this is even real sophisticated in the photographic process , which shows that there &apos;s a limb within a few days .
and on this right , you see what six months later has happened , the engineered <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> algorithm is comprised of two different types of types .
we then put it back in this oven-like device device .
even more complex organs . those are the most complex solid organs that are highly charged with every host of animals like heart , liver and liver and toxins .
it &apos;s still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that will not reject and create a tumor .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there , anyone could have an idea .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m at a moment in panic -- different than all of the zero and sugar , which i had -- but this is actually a entrepreneur &apos;s truly entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you need to visit a <unk> visit .
i walked from door to door and sold <unk> .
it &apos;s like a recession recession . so , there &apos;s a recession recession .
and you would do that chairs .
it &apos;s useless . &apos; &quot; you have to find a way to get faster on money .
i was dragging bounty of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks , and they &apos;re learning the ability of dopamine , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if they &apos;re going to go into a restaurant and do badly , they show you what it looks like worse .
these boys , <unk> .
the development of the students today is taking everybody else &apos;s interests .
<unk> of <unk> or a cultural <unk> on cultural <unk> deprive the most of our students .
the scores of the past are also also resurrected . it makes a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what we should look at , when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- they &apos;re going to go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that leads to just another outcome , and it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
in fact , this is not a true organization , but clear -- i want to conclude -- creative commons offers a simple way to put your content out with the freedoms you want to leave with you .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often this is happening .
he told me that he had the <unk> <unk> , and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to go there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i was going through this process and show you what it looks like .
and the hospital , general , was also very happy .
i was surviving , just to let us understand it .
i &apos;m always asked by people asking , &quot; is it truly possible to encourage these microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
another way to think microbes can spread through human rights throughout people . architects organize spaces like complex interactions , to facilitate the human interactions , to promote the human interactions , for example , labs and offices .
imagine a design that takes microbes , for example , on the airplane , for example , on the airplane or on a phone .
and no one knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in &apos; &apos; 70s , they were constrained by <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to get the <unk> , and one way that they wanted to do that was , in fact , one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> percent of the voices , to give them an idea of the <unk> , <unk> 2 in the <unk> , only 3 percent .
and the last message i &apos;d like to share with you is : you can be successful .
i don &apos;t need to say , i don &apos;t need to explain what a privilege of it is to stand today in front of you today .
this is the school that was built with community .
something that we have in gando are <unk> .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a very good way to be <unk> , to try to make things that make science tomorrow .
there &apos;s color red and the color black black , you &apos;re standing for the constant shift from day to night .
voice : why don &apos;t it ? it &apos;s a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t take a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first , the state in china is very special -- has a very special level of value than the united states , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , of the <unk> .
he had been working in <unk> <unk> , <unk> beijing with shanghai and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the <unk> -- the position of the <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he rides on tracks down a road in the neighborhood , and the cars are going to go down there .
red = <unk> blue gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga gaga coded adhesive .
and the first song was in english , the second was in chinese .
she politely agreed her song .
i performed on graffiti , my name used to go around , used the city as canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they were all accepted that their painting on each other would be teaming up with each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re thinking , you &apos;re going to cut a <unk> face -- right ? &quot;
most of the places that i went , i decided , because i &apos;d heard about them in the media .
i took more photos , and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were <unk> , <unk> a woman , &quot; now i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there are layers behind every photo .
but they were basically taken away from me into a gift .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
and if i think about the interconnectedness and what it &apos;s about , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there &apos;s some kind of factors that i want to give you to you as <unk> .
they sparked a trend .

i started exploring the <unk> <unk> of human mind .
this time , i said , let &apos;s try something different .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . so einstein is very privileged to be here at ted 2006 between the united states of america , and indeed she is very excited .

and i think there &apos;s a very important lesson for us to do all of us .
and it turns out that we &apos;re covered by a <unk> , and these microbes don &apos;t usually do us well , instead of killing us .
they &apos;ve put all microbes dumping , and the manure then used in the recipient .
the most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , contained one or two , perhaps five species , and the human community has thousands upon thousands of species .

she went up on her side and keep her up .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;

stairs , the <unk> of a <unk> winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to give you an illusion that if you &apos;re going to get this lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without cords .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolic of the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very complicated and <unk> .

after a few years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> system that generates the nervous nervous system of the spinal cord injury .
we &apos;ve spent 10 years working on trying to get this goal .
after a couple of weeks , we &apos;re going to put a programmable pump to one of these <unk> <unk> straight into the spinal cord .

they didn &apos;t have anything .
so , the internet takes off and instructions .
one of the most popular sites in the world , which is done by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to be done on youtube or google .

usually you don &apos;t have a lot of stuff in los angeles , but there is a place where you can walk a lot , out in that city .
and then they will be feeling as false as <unk> -- by applying traits that they don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted and stayed for me alone .
then it wasn &apos;t going to start to start at one point and then it went to the <unk> .
so i built it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing , because since i was a kid , i wanted my passion and love .
twenty-five days : the danger of 32 days : arms and hands develop 36 days , the primitive anesthesia is starting to form these weeks from the period of time that the fetus is evolving at the fastest time .
the complexity in one system is built beyond every comprehension of every understanding , or every person today that there is no mathematics at all .
because apparently , this <unk> <unk> <unk> isn &apos;t in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with the spectra ?
there &apos;s a fellow in berkeley recently , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum , and said , &quot; can you look at it ? &quot;
there are two ways — about <unk> and <unk> stars -- on top of matter and chemical elements in the universe , they produce and <unk> elements in the universe .
because can you imagine that everything ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t possibly can &apos;t explain , and we just stand up and say , &quot; so , we can &apos;t . physics can &apos;t . &quot;
and when we see clusters of oxygen , oxygen , then i think we have the perfect point .
i was only thought , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
and what i can tell you is : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a small collapse -- -- which was actually more likely .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what gives you the sense of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you &apos;re not right . hang out .
we pretend that what we do is have no impact on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , <unk> <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so , if we think about trying to make systematic improvements , then we think we can also think about how they can be useful to our <unk> , to our <unk> and self-knowledge .
and today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the things we eventually decided we wanted to do , we wanted to find a new public health access to public health .
steven is his story . but it &apos;s not his own .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love that <unk> <unk> , and these were the only <unk> that were available online and available online and available .
and here we have another paper .
you don &apos;t have a data company , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not going to work for scientific methods .
this is the curve of the circular mill .
but my brother , with him , went to the end .
now , if we went from here to <unk> , we would run into something like this , which is 300 feet tall , 60 miles long , 28 miles wide , and it weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you only need two volts of one <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a very intriguing solution from what comes from what &apos;s called <unk> .
these are networks of networks , networks , complex systems , complex systems .
and it also does impact on systemic risk .
so , for example , we could borrow every <unk> match .
and we see the emergence of evolution and <unk> programs , which aimed to understand our wired world from the point of view of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these tools ready to be prepared .
without human production .
so , we were up on top of our teammates .
and this graph is not even something that is invented yet .
and my brain starts to think very rapidly , that this is a semantic view of <unk> in the world .
because this issue is going to determine that our external world can predict our twin worlds , but the reality is that i can predict only 10 percent of the <unk> of the world &apos;s external world .
and this is from two reasons , scientifically <unk> and curves around .
and we &apos;re forcing people when they open up their <unk> , trying to write a positive email from the <unk> or to write someone in their social environment .
difficult to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , <unk> .
they said , &quot; do it crash . &quot;
they take a big floppy studio out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media company in tokyo .
do you hear this ? like cows ? this is in logan four o &apos;clock in logan .
so , there are all sorts of things to do , but most love me to make the world , taste .
and i &apos;m obsessed with passion .
their culture is not in schools . and i want to see how we can break this problem .
so this makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools who don &apos;t have a boy .
and over little moments in my life .
or <unk> , the young people have raised ?
we need to change attitudes toward boys in primary school .
and you &apos;ve got the idea that you believe , that would be ok .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re transported this hypothesis .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give these &quot; why &quot; <unk> can give us the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a very important lesson for me that you could not actually affect on an object .
for example , we created a newspaper newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s restrained with my ipad connected with my ipad , and this is a software running on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> , so i wanted to add it to a <unk> so people in the glass , so that people will react in the glass of different ways you &apos;re headed towards it .
from my best , i &apos;m going to transform into a man of middle age , and then i &apos;m going to turn into an old man .
<unk> extra bets were allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
just fold the wings together and drive them .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a different question .
and he had a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who had tagged him day and night and night , but the secret instruction , it &apos;s not very gratifying .
because they figured out that institutional behavior is a human behavior .
yet , we have to create a lot of <unk> <unk> , where you can create this type of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we have all of these tools , we have to ask ourselves the question -- and culturally and <unk> , this is what we used to use these smart .
they take the new <unk> team .
it gives little , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , heart and heart , had left my body .
audience member : no .
sb : no , no . &quot;
around us , <unk> <unk> is going to find another jobs in this <unk> culture of culture .
you &apos;ve probably got them probably .
imagine the world full of both memes and memes as a space for them .
we are the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong thing .
it was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to look at the resource of the planet to produce more and more , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we see this third problem , as we finally walked through the second and first of all ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- that &apos;s the haiti earthquake in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with different trepidation , we raise more than 1,500 buildings .
it won &apos;t cost us more when we &apos;re doing it right . &quot;
and because i had dropped to 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also have found that it would have been good , if you &apos;d been able to recover from pain , you &apos;d have eliminated me to recover from pain .
and how bad would you would be if i would catch ?
it was not so that the <unk> people -- who , who had more commandments <unk> -- less tribal commandments would -- those who have less religious -- those who had dropped themselves from almost no commandments .
so if you don &apos;t think about money for a few seconds , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
so , it &apos;s like this .
i think that all of these forces have a very bad impact on the exchange .
but you can think of it . i &apos;m collaborating in the commercial .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and then of course , amazon is going to brand a brand and competing with it , depending on how you spend your money , what money is , what money is and what it is .
maybe that might seem a big jump ?
in the audience , i probably didn &apos;t need to go on -- last week , i had to describe it , and i had to describe it -- these are structure structures that relay from one individual to another .
and i knew that animals like this , like the <unk> , or even most of the animals , they don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by digging them around bones .
and that was because every one of the interventions that we found out until nature had found out about the same <unk> .
and everyone i showed that were really surprised .
a funny song about the global warming , by jill sobule .
well , i must probably have to now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a play game ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the benefits of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> is totally out of it , and there &apos;s been a latch on top of it .
go on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced , my homeland , the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> , the <unk> of the united nations , has doubled the wealth of the country over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not yet yet .
they needed to have very inexpensive to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done on the <unk> of the <unk> ?
they appealed from the government to support government , and in many cases they got them too .
but let &apos;s look at what we think our goal would be to launch new economic growth on the base of the pyramid .
because they &apos;d need a whole pile of those little transactions to make their profit .
he liked to sit it on your lap because he said it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since <unk> , as sir <unk> <unk> , and the british society for <unk> , is why the sun does shine .
so , what &apos;s merger ? something &apos;s leaked here .
and that energy is launching that merger .
as a result , a lot of the way to do it is to do with conventional wisdom .
we have to do it at a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a huge impact .
however , they wanted most of the democracies , but they were from all the countries who had the lowest law in the last month , and they had a clerks stated in the last month , and they were only four percent .
but the people &apos; expectations for their future have got to be significant .
and so the question is , &quot; what drives your husband &apos;s support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , you &apos;ve read the news .
no one can listen to them , they &apos;re just sending a text message out there .
you could see the immediate implications of law , or who &apos;s going to see an <unk> speech on a <unk> , and see what &apos;s going on as a consequence .
flight took about 20 seconds and went about 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest distance to the mammoth storms of nature &apos;s storms .
we can do it as individuals , and we can do it as a member of them .
we believe that someone else is going to make someone else someone else , someone who is going to solve that problem with more tools to solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it into the pacific .
it took 10 pieces of prototypes until we had something that was really flown .
and so there &apos;s one side on the side of it , which is done , which is allowed to be , and this is serious what it means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral footprint .
and the director was quite <unk> , and he said to me that he was talking mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are tough .
it needed several distinct things to explore , until i discovered what i needed to do .
when i started in front of four years ago with this program , my twin idea was to create a <unk> approach .
and they &apos;re looking down at <unk> , everything &apos;s so small and tiny .
and i feel blessed and fortunate that i had the courage 15 years ago from nyu on nyu , and return to my homeland , where i can make these amazing <unk> children from ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often i would have to die before i realized that it doesn &apos;t exist from beginning to it ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly enough , these insights don &apos;t include my sense of otherness , that sense of otherness .
it was because i had no self who was in between .
imagine what kinds of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of ourselves , the privilege of life , and what we &apos;re excited about is what comes next .
and this is a cafe on the u.k.
but instead of what we &apos;re looking for , we &apos;re focused on how it works .
and what we discovered was , we also discovered that like a structure structure and a <unk> way through that structure .
but what we found was that seed -- this really important thing is , you know , it &apos;s about -- but that seed -- in the leading <unk> botanical gardens , will not exist .
we worked with a golf cart trying to develop a fundraiser of the seed , so that even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it was kind of <unk> and soft , the playful landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few games that you see , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular notion , because that human spirit is a blank slate and all its culture &apos;s structure , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a bunch of political reasons for people to look good for people .
it &apos;s still not clear though it &apos;s still not clear about it , but it seemed to be the uplifting driver of this .
one of them is <unk> and <unk> at universities who are in <unk> , who are in <unk> terms in decline .
well , the other thing is about iron .
and i think you can &apos;t even say this .
i &apos;m also also admired about <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but they say it .
there &apos;s no script there , there &apos;s no script there , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i currently think . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer computer computer computer -- that &apos;s odd .
so , i asked myself what would happen if we challenging some of these <unk> problems .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve done the job of the war as a society , as a society , from each of us .
your iphone without the people who are the same envelope , same sequencing circuits , the same keyboard , always done and over again .
and then it &apos;s been thicker , and it &apos;s thicker , and it &apos;s now <unk> pages .
and i said to brian , &quot; what does tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you have faked this in here ? &quot;
but how do you react to a mentally normal sense ?
so there were all sorts of things that went on on tony <unk> , evidence for his clinician , that he &apos;s going to be on this new way .
he came in in <unk> businesses , <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , transformed american towns just like this in <unk> .
and i put on top , i put a list of psychopathic characteristics in my pocket .
and the <unk> are always the most extreme of the personality of the interviewee .
anyway , that was two years ago , and this is where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to <unk> from the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m <unk> the true islam . &quot;
it might be that a big war between the east and west became <unk> , and that it was necessary in the fundamental democracy of communism .
and even though the president , for tactical reasons , is very , very good with islam , which is not the enemy , yet there is nonetheless natural pulse in <unk> the other side to the other side as a enemy .
when the sound bites in the year 2000 , you saw the peak of the best <unk> researchers who had submitted the scientists for the african penguins -- that at the same time as a <unk> art .
on the day after our arrival , two of us went out with the room room about 2 2 holes , and room 2 pounds more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we used this method on the side of the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because the african penguin has been explained a year ago a year ago .
at the <unk> row , on the <unk> row , there &apos;s a <unk> , in front of a <unk> , and even before the station station .
people are open up to the <unk> .
we launched these campaign -- very eager -- &quot; every egg count . &quot;
this is not <unk> in the second class .
those lessons came out , abstract <unk> , abstract .
hillel <unk> on a leg and said , &quot; what you don &apos;t do is do your neighbor . that &apos;s the st elevation . the rest of it is critical .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles picks up <unk> <unk> and hands him carefully at his father , and the two men look at each other and see each other as divine .
so , this view of the brain is actually drawn into biology and science , looking at it from living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size about a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these <unk> polygons .
this picture was the beginning of the beginning of the <unk> .
we all look at the same from the inside , trust me .
the walls are from 700 millimeters , solid concrete concrete , solid concrete concrete .
and that on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all these little <unk> in the <unk> .
i had to put the car in the middle of it , and i didn &apos;t really have a real simple job .
yeah , you &apos;ve got 12 monkeys for one week , and after this week , they used to use them only as toilet .
the science actually says we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m dragging a tooth tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much . goodbye .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree with each other .
not professor and <unk> , only two spirits , ready to lease .
and then my life at that time was my life .
what i saw in the making was that there were right <unk> between the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
then , wouldn &apos;t it be time to digest information ?
we spend a lot of time playing a billion dollars business , and they &apos;re doing right — there &apos;s a billion <unk> <unk> that he &apos;s been involved with , and what we found was shocking , but it later more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were horrified that shell companies had dropped out of sewers and the most important in london , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to do all of the old stuff . we &apos;re going to get everybody out of the room . people are leaving us .
there are sites where you cannot step , you don &apos;t think you can &apos;t , worlds you can &apos;t take longer .
they have a <unk> and a freedom from which i believe they have the platform of a new explosive .
she made the decision not to get <unk> or <unk> , but her life is devoted to none other girls .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you get me on this thing about your head , and then it &apos;s going to happen .
but this does not do her . &quot;
i really miss michael .
and he didn &apos;t find it , his employees <unk> him and said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go into rehab , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the <unk> beloved , let us pull out of us .
if it &apos;s on this box , which is the <unk> , then it forms it .
the characteristics of <unk> are so often in adulthood , realizing that we can abolish this aging term out of age when it comes to <unk> behavior , which is associated with <unk> and institutional thinking .
if i <unk> my sister &apos;s ability to pay attention 10 percent interest paying attention to her last loan , i &apos;m going to have her ability to earn more money from myself until she got it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live more in the dark times .
and the third one is all the kind of sound that we &apos;re creating human beings , the <unk> .
and this is after selected <unk> .
there &apos;s lots of wild wild wild , among other things , the way that animals have taught us to sing and sing .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much this is , this is 16 1k here .
so , 37 is our demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the issues that we &apos;re actually most excited about .
one generation that takes much more value out of video games than in the real world .
these are all problems outside of my specialty .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games for our culture is .
finally ! yes ! that was it .
it would like it correctly well .
so , you get fast from the simple complex complex , if you do more , you like it .
and then they look at them , and kind of a pain -- i thought , for a long time , until she explained to me , it was something that they think about it , so they think .
let &apos;s go to the other direction .
girl : there &apos;s a bullet and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two totally different <unk> , and if you drop them at the same time , you might fall asleep .
but we could not afford a thousand new teachers to rescue our lives .
and it &apos;s a <unk> response . &quot;
and eventually , we will change ourselves as well as we have changed the world around us .
it &apos;s going to have incredible impact .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody wants the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re even <unk> at that moment .
i &apos;m going to look at his words exactly in order .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; odd you ask this question .
she said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t need to do that anymore . &quot;
we saw this , and i was appreciative , because she was just saying , &quot; wow ! this is madness . &quot;
the goal of this project is very simple .
this is totally personalized in <unk> .
well , the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , what some of the serious problems on the project , the problems that it didn &apos;t have to have .
in medicine , there are a lot of people who don &apos;t want to change a change , first , if an <unk> engineer the answer .
you can &apos;t find novel solutions , which haven &apos;t been seen yet , and so fast and simple .
so , well , you guys have a lot of suffering in my life , because <unk> used to be about it , from beautiful <unk> shape .
no , but it is true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t urge you to paint nice sketches .
thank you very much .
so , &quot; our lonely planet took me every big deal with the audience with the audience .
we still have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here before , until we reach the second microbial age .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin <unk> over the whole planet , and we had a very bright death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and <unk> on it and so much else .
it &apos;s the top eating , the <unk> of his time .
they hate us to hate animals .
this is when material comes from the depths of the earth and the surface , you know , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m removed from shore from shore , what will happen with me ?
they have an accident . they have two options , they will die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide , and they say 75 percent of them will be saved , psychologically .
<unk> : blessing and curse .
some of them are countries who are opinion , that <unk> , or even cost-effective , the best way to promote money is to promote trade .
and the answer is simple , the chinese are these factories than chemical businesses , not as <unk> , and checking them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can &apos;t use my office at least in order to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a food food system .
now , we have the idea that it is about the beginning of a new way and the regulation of international international tasks .
human rights is a very simple question : can i put his dignity back ?
or , or find the guy who had laid out the fire , to see if you can change it . &quot;
ok , ready ? go .
i was fire and i was flame .
again , again , again , we saw the spoken spoken walls walls .
after the struggle , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re god . &apos; &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i have a lot of time when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students reaching her third step , but i was with charlotte &apos;s luck to see that her journey has evolved as she did it .
my parents call me sarah , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some ideas that drove me to become a priesthood .
when i saw that the war for each of these computable <unk> , and that was indeed a factor in <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a photographer to be a member of the <unk> .
in south africa , after nelson mandela <unk> out of prison mandela in jail , who had been resigned in the last phase of liberation from apartheid .
the next day i went on to rwanda , and it was , as i walked into the <unk> , the hell i went up with the hell .
in indonesia , from indonesia in indonesia , i started looking at the conditions of poverty in a country that was headed for modernization .
a hospital of doctors without borders , in a refugee camps .
the energy production has become so efficient , the proportion of the soldiers that are surviving a lot higher in this culture than in any other history of our history .
to make sure that as little as possible can be wrong , we have all these procedures in choice .
so you can select this way .
but this is a wide and a pretty tough thing , so i had to cut my own .
the size of the population is -- here big china , here , here big india .
and in the eastern religions , since japan , it was equal to the same .
because the death of a child will be teaming up with another child .
and what is qatar in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , like everyone else of our generation , we lived in a <unk> zone .
day eight .
just in india , my favorite best friends , friends , and i had door to door with this same view , to every single house in india , we made about a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- they &apos;re all <unk> -- and i asked them the questions they &apos;d like to ask you .
i think we owe it to the <unk> and ron st. john &apos;s a lot of gratitude , i hope , ron &apos;s in the audience somewhere -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , are you not pissed off because of the copyright failure ?
built a <unk> , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why do we want to have a positive impact on the world , like a company ?
they &apos;ll save 85 percent electricity with one led that they would use an old light bulb that they would use with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think 100 percent will be pretty difficult , and we had this conversation in business .
one <unk> paid himself in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 <unk> in <unk> , there are 47 percent of women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to follow this gap and we want to follow this gap .
there was one equation in my family , about this : when you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re not feeling <unk> .
so , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the disconnected structure of reality . &quot;
someone who takes you , or your positioning , or your positioning , from your ears .
at the end of our teammates , we realized the openness of the other .
anyway , i would return to bangalore and often <unk> discussions with my friends at home , where we &apos;ve been discussing different subjects with new <unk> , where a drink would often cost more than what they paid for your 14 years old <unk> .
he search for forgiveness , and he claimed he wants struggling to improve his child &apos;s life .
and that <unk> seemed to be pretty happy , and none of the deaths have been killed , even though it had killed dozens of liberia in liberia .
and what are we responsible for ?
it &apos;s alarming -- not ? -- that the media in the world will make a bad job , that a small group of activists is able to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the world combined .
j yeah . this is the front page in the guardian , and then in all sorts of countries around the world , in <unk> and south poverty .
j the impact on the people who worked on it were considerably considerably .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i &apos;m interested in just because of what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of the ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you must be careful with the term hackers .
and just a month ago , all of the sudden parliament passed away from <unk> parliament .
and so from all those numbers , i &apos;m going to start with only two or three variables .
this piece can be revealed differently , depending on where you <unk> it .
well , first of all , i was reading about this in a graduation program , and it &apos;s done by responsible for responsible medicine for responsible medicine and seven <unk> .
so , according to that , i think the best way to make a chicken is not too short , but certainly not too long until it turns black , to be black , and a lemon on lemon juice , lemon sugar or salt .

think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i saw an article in the new york times .

that &apos;s how evolution works .
and indeed , here &apos;s this insect .

i have a <unk> history .
our life is determined by data , and the presentation of this data is for us to create a chance of creating fantastic interface that magnificent stories can tell .

thank you very much .
so i set out pictures of pictures , cut , and put them together in <unk> .
and a lengthy implication of it is that you can always see a part of his image , and that leads to a very free design .
and sometimes i have a emotional response on news , like the haiti earthquake in haiti .
then i walked 50 kilometers , 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the disparate layers that we &apos;re made of , and what we &apos;re doing when we present our identity as our identity .

that should worry about me , i couldn &apos;t deal with them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that i &apos;m interested in .
this is already today .
it can be a smartphone , or it might be a smartphone , or it might be a particularly aggressive <unk> , like many of these things are special because they &apos;re not so well embedded .
many of them have the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our lives , we &apos;re going to sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now , let &apos;s go from the sleep to diseases .
so , we can change the medicine in the <unk> throughout all ages , from <unk> or <unk> to the seniors ; the <unk> arena change , the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i owe you a sense of it -- all around the globe .
so , i &apos;ve convinced you , i &apos;ve convinced you -- the impact on the vector are massive , and the impact on disease is also so impressive in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , one particular thing called alvin is produced , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and destroyed the whole system .
and so , they wouldn &apos;t be there .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
it was going to be faster than it should be faster .
maybe they &apos;re wondering how we do these <unk> .
our is the only rendering of the world in the world where <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the finished hamburger hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a lecture about doing surgery .
and surgeons were more often more people than doctors .
but eventually , the house is awakened .
they had to forgo their intuitive movements with the instrumentation .
i told them from the big , complicated robots .
and as you see , as it turns out , to do something useful to do something useful , cannot stay there .
and we don &apos;t even have to satisfy ourselves in these <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
ok , well , it was partially my fault .
and we haven &apos;t just shown that bacteria can be the solution for trash , but , too , the openness to <unk> <unk> , and we can create unexpected unexpected discoveries .
the movie that we see in the same is made for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not going to be an exception .
it went beyond . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t have said , &quot; our style is curves . let &apos;s make the house <unk> . &quot;
i think in my family , we were very lucky in my family , because we learned design robotics .
so , of course , very good .
ed : and then finally , <unk> row is a historical <unk> . there &apos;s a <unk> history in the <unk> of <unk> in the united states here , where the embassy has taken .
do you see this chair there ? the orange one ? this is the <unk> <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to be .
they were musicians full of outrage ; they were filled from speculation , they were <unk> . no robust information .
one of them is known : the population explosion , the population of two billion people in the world , has dropped by two billion people in the last 50 years .
brent <unk> : be beautiful here .
you see , the lines check it when the population is going on .
before i even talk about the costs , i have to say very powerfully .
so there actually looks really liberation .
but only since the recently , we &apos;ve been able to demonstrate very much more technical progress , and we can begin to demonstrate the quantum theory and quantum locking .
so , first of all strands of magnetic strands on interior interior magnetic strands , but the levitating doesn &apos;t like it when they use it , because they use energy to use energy and so forth .
so , that circular magnet can expand , obviously , to create a random rail structure .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , and the situation is from &quot; by moving through the galaxy . &quot;
because obviously they don &apos;t explain how to do it if you don &apos;t want to make it yourself .
but even though they didn &apos;t say , they said , &quot; oh , okay , we &apos;re falling back . &quot; they never did .
<unk> : yeah , i got .
so some of them will say , &quot; what will happen when moore &apos;s law will come across his borders ? &quot;
today they can buy half a billion , and they &apos;re even better because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
now , larry page has delivered a passionate speech on our <unk> , who downloads himself to bring this great challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary to hear the many <unk> , bigger than the last , to come up with exactly 13 watch , or perhaps , or perhaps night , or perhaps .
so it can be seen as a kind of <unk> moment , a moment where the blogosphere has kind of grown up with it .
probably it would probably fall from three to five percent of the number of <unk> in the glass , and it would be better than the estimates of 90 percent until 95 percent of them .
somebody has links something , so they link others as well , etc . , etc .
and he cuts off his <unk> , and i &apos;m waiting for a 300 pounds of dry pounds of paper , but he &apos;s only saying , &quot; this is all i want to do with you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now 30 seconds movie of this object without the skin on top of it .
that habitat covers more far more of the surface than all of the habitats combined .
many of us , i &apos;m involved in thinking , thinking that the exploitation of the ocean in human beings has been really serious about 50 or perhaps 100 years ago .
these are <unk> vehicles , our eyes and hands on the sea floor .
so , there &apos;s a barcode on this product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do it , we don &apos;t know it .
this graph is based on a brand-new article that occurs in the scientific academic biology .
but that &apos;s not even done yet .
as an architect , i have a bit of a wider way .
mitchell joachim : do you build a house , grow it !
so , i find this very interesting and very unorthodox , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of going to go in different directions , directions that are specific and unique for the problems .
now , we all think that <unk> , obviously , was a vast romantic poet , many of us forgot that he had written some wonderful changes in it , and the most famous essay is one called &quot; defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read you this .
and at a certain time of his life , they looked at rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic technology .
if you used to , in front of the radio radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; on the <unk> , that was the kind of noise .
and the basic idea of <unk> <unk> is that you have two sources of information from the conclusions of the conclusions .
that means i need to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear case , which is where one of me feels different from me differently than it was produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules about the other person .
if these dots were on a <unk> car , they wouldn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can actually use a great part of the data -- people actually plan themselves to use their movements quite precisely to reduce the negatives of the noise .
this is eliminated iv iv iv iv iv .
mars has the largest solar system in the solar system , the solar system .
this is my favorite . it was taken just a couple weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the outcome of our head was a <unk> <unk> called ares .
we &apos;re folding it , and we &apos;re moving it into a <unk> system .
this is about <unk> , oregon .
i believe on the dispensers , let &apos;s look at here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the <unk> -- no , they &apos;re not in guns .

i have to tell you , for me , in that evening , everything had changed everything .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other businesses is enormous .
indeed , politics is inherently robust .
in brazil , there are now <unk> <unk> , whereas the united states only means 700 , and <unk> two in california , and within three years , the proportion to <unk> percent gone up from four percent to 85 percent .
this is not <unk> . biofuels are a big big thing .
scientists -- and these are just estimates -- and these are just estimates -- that we need to break from greenhouse gases , which is as rapidly as possible .
i can &apos;t quite expect what we currently call tedsters towards the crisis .
there &apos;s still fewer people who are still available to you , and then you &apos;re approaching this <unk> of the curve , and you get this classic sigmoidal curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this is what happens to every particle .
the red dots will be the <unk> , and the yellow points will be friends of people with flu .
would you get <unk> out of <unk> ?
and there are , i think , three kinds of data that can be used to be used .
and the building was in construction , on the collapse of the <unk> economy and death of the <unk> in the beginning of the 1990s .
and although it seems to be a totally more complex place , if you look at it from the top , obviously there &apos;s a whole network of <unk> and channels that tie every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride is all about her possessions that will soon bring them to their new husband .
what a place like the <unk> david makes especially remarkable , is this kind of incubation where people have a bottom-up idea they can use .
so , we can only ask ourselves , &quot; how are the <unk> of <unk> ? &quot; and do it immediately -- or what we want to ask , or whatever we want to ask .
it &apos;s the workers replaced by technology .
you can see on the left in the screen some of the components that show what to do with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even , if we grow a lot older , we can visit our cars so we can visit people .
they were living in a moment .
it became increasingly obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me get the result on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what happens there ? &quot;
the tailings ponds are <unk> , same as the custom level .
i think there are a lot , actually many reasons , but there are only some of the reasons that we just focus on .
he was attracted by the fire , he was dressed , he was dressed , he was like a light bulb on light , a little bit of a <unk> .
so , let me go from door to door to door in the international community and see if someone gives me a <unk> or troops for those .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw them .
<unk> power : a complicated hero of a complicated hero
this is jobs and possibilities of all kinds of <unk> along the way .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about food , because actually this year , last year , and in 2008 , enough food , last year , and <unk> food , for every cost of food .
and i &apos;m going to go into those stores , if you &apos;re sitting there , or <unk> out into the fields to see what you can get , and i realize you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in schools by girls .
i want to talk about something i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in a school feeding program .
thanks very much .
we could do the same with cancer .
they &apos;re no longer going to go into a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it teaches me how many regulators i am doing every day , but it &apos;s been <unk> 24 hours a long time , but it &apos;s been monitored by 24 hours doing what i do .
that &apos;s never been shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technology , a single neutron with this technology .
you don &apos;t have to hate the tumor .
if the magnet is large enough , and your resolution is very accurate enough , then you can actually turn all the proteins into your body and begin to understand the individual system .
most of us find that small , and interestingly , are 12 cycles per minute about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
so for example , if i took this -- no longer than a couple seconds , they &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; they were longer than a couple minutes , and they &apos;re going to leave the house in teams .
you &apos;ve all recognized that . and this is the tune to the time in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends from me , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we go cross-country and miles from <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
so as i stand here today and talk to you , i walked over the <unk> of about five years ago .
100 miles off off shore and 12,000 feet off the coast of rock .
the oceans determine climate and weather , and they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> there are light ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are limits to what we need to take the ocean .
for example , in the last three years , the u.s. , for example , have been protected , for example , is protected than protected .
we need <unk> , new technologies to exploration of the ocean .
for a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough force to stay in the air .
let &apos;s specify this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of the optical <unk> of a mouse from the lab by jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they have a belief system to make some kind of behavior , a different act of dna , a different molding , and you can think , and you can think that this is happening in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and build <unk> computer in the human brain system .
it &apos;s home and drinks tea .
so if you look at the characteristics of the neocortex , you guarantee that it &apos;s made out of a lot of little components . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many a <unk> tree is there ? where are you static ?
we can look at tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can upload these neurons , every single thing in his own processor , activating it , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain cannot be solved . mental disorders , memory , perceptions , perceptions of neurons and electric signals , and he has to extract them with a supercomputer that &apos;s the brain at <unk> synapses .
it would be two or three thousand bombs of bombs .
the air force started making smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a spacecraft that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic thing to do , because there is so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
so if you ask people this question , they usually think that it has something to do with culture .
the nations on the right , the ones who give a lot , have a slightly different form of form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it turns back to bring it back , once again , becoming more complex .
an online dating project for 59 dollars .
and the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t really know our <unk> .
in terms of bringing in medicine , this is our vision .
and radio waves are bounded .
infrared -- you can use to the <unk> of your eyes only with limited energy .
their intensity can be very rapidly modeled , and they can become very rapidly turned off .
they are critical . they &apos;re critical . they &apos;re critical . they are critical . they are critical . they are critical . they are critical .
but only by the way .
automobiles have automobiles and <unk> and can communicate with each other and through the <unk> lights can communicate with cars and whatnot .
dna is what life is mean .
actually , this is actually not really a lot of data .
you have the <unk> genome , and you have a custom version of a custom drug that &apos;s better than the ones today -- they have no side effects whatsoever .
it &apos;s really simple -- just <unk> genes -- but we could completely synthesize it .
we &apos;re not going to run as small organisms in the world alone , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
and the consequences can be bad -- if we get rid of us or the earth , but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us errors .
now , i &apos;m mostly here because it &apos;s kind of digging up , because there &apos;s some kind of <unk> on the moment where we have people who think you have a dog , first set by rules , first by set rules , by rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; just to beat . and therefore , they &apos;re hit .
no , we &apos;re going to make &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- eh , he can try to do it for six to 10 .
these are like golden <unk> .
and i would say if you didn &apos;t need it , maybe you wouldn &apos;t be it .
not just with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
your children are just learning .
wk : i want to make a windmill a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- is it working ?
wk : yeah . i always think about trying to work with energy .
because while i used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very hard to make them sound <unk> .
and yet , if it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is white light light .
64 multiplying multiplying by 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert <unk> a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus made the same tool for 100,000 centuries .
you can teach them in the lab , and you can teach them a little bit more co-developers , and there &apos;s actually a lot of other animals , but the exchange of one object is never going to happen .
it &apos;s wealth ; it &apos;s pleasurable to be able to save your own needs of time .
this is what we have done as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence .
and when people started creating objects like this , which was a pretty clue that there was a relationship between groups of groups .
but who knows how to make a computer sanitary ?
but this is also because of the ties that people who are taking people , and who &apos;s never going to have the opportunity to meet and meet with meetings , and i am also sure that technology continues on , and therefore the technology will continue to continue going forward .
so , this is as much as a temporary building . i have seen here the statue as compared as compared .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take serious .
these are just gone away , those feelings , they &apos;ve gone .
so , if we think about the <unk> <unk> problem , then generally the fast development problem is the problem , because how can we discover things that are changing constantly ?
i &apos;ve talked about this -- do you know this situation , if you &apos;re not going to get a diagnostic response in the hospital in the hospital ?
what about true people ?
we <unk> a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so they &apos;ve been interacting with each other <unk> .
after 10 days of a fever , she came back -- still a fever -- she has <unk> -- little oxygen in her lungs lungs .
it was not even very common .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new . no one has ever seen it before .
it might have a big battery that it could .
so , let &apos;s do something instead of thinking about <unk> <unk> .
i put a florescent tag with low density rise up , a latch of high density down , and molten salt between it .
but david is young , and he wants a <unk> , and he wants to make it -- he &apos;ll build the exact first liquid battery battery with this chemical chemistry rig with this chemical composition of this chemical composition .
so what have we learned from all this ?
this video was taken in the icefall area . 6 kilometers off the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface calms down below sea level .
we realized that our garage wasn &apos;t big enough for this growing project .
i started to look at maria <unk> and their methods , and how they found those kids , and how important they found that kids are discovering things themselves , and they &apos;re not going to be taught to be in an open style .
evolution is often seen as one way we have selected , but it represents a tremendous number of possibilities .
i will skip this will skip time for space exploration .
our towns are endangered because many of them are lying on shore .
there &apos;s also stars and whatnot .
so if we think about darwinian behavior , or body language , as it calls the social speech , then it turns about language . so we think about communication .
this phrase also known as a pride , by jessica tracy , by jessica tracy and from a blind people doing this , when they were born in a <unk> .
so i thought about this . you see these people , and you see what they participate . could you get them to slow them and then they would participate more ?
what happens on a top-down approach , what happens when they took on the <unk> level ? like the following little manipulation , these tiny <unk> ?
this is happening in the lab . the little practice , for just a few minutes , where you can really use it ? that was , of course , important .
things like that . people show you the truth . they show themselves themselves .
she was completely depressed , and he said , &quot; i have nothing here here . &quot;
you need your body , privacy and two minutes , and it can change more life in your body .
<unk> swim <unk> to get your paws on your <unk> , <unk> <unk> , put your into the brain , and you &apos;re going to go through a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have some kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s what i believe , richard and i think that these ideas aren &apos;t being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re extinct now .
but under all those ideas that really spread out of our technology in the world , we have a lot of toxic ideas .
and like with viruses , we shouldn &apos;t try to <unk> them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody &apos;s listening to each other . no one knows the other .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in some kind of <unk> <unk> .
and i don &apos;t want to suggest that that shouldn &apos;t have happened , but we need to get better when it comes to answer the questions that you need to consider , if you think about the implications and the response .
they &apos;re working in <unk> . they &apos;re educators .
five dollars can save a life .
it deserves about two dollars a day , which is a twitter processor and told me that they will not have married kids , they will not be married until those things are toast .
eventually , from despair , they went and <unk> a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , when you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to have the best speech you ever care about .
ok , the vast majority of us .
and so his message was basically unity , the combination of everything , and the unity of everything , and his basic value was respect to strangers , was kindness towards strangers .
who &apos;s struggling for him ?
they have started to go , in israel , palestine , in turkey , in syria , in syria .
and so , more and more , and more <unk> , and as recently as a result , they finally got a income to support your family .
just go on to someone with another culture , from another country , from another country , which is kind of different , and you engage them in a conversation ; listen to him .
i &apos;m going to start where the story started , 1985 in <unk> .
this morning , before you <unk> , who had the opportunity to take a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this less famous homes , where 50,000 indigenous people living , 35 percent of homes had a working shower .
now , 21 percent of what we fix , is follow <unk> , things that actually got nailed into it .
we did this . he got a notebook <unk> .
we found later that in this area , <unk> is the cause of diseases and death .
one thing is , in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , in the mid- &apos; 50s , &apos; nelson mandela said not far from here , &quot; slavery and apartheid is not <unk> . it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t feel it when they call me a <unk> . really not .
it sounds really <unk> to say that from there , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s really ineffective .
so with that point , i &apos;m trying to ask you , in fact , that kids don &apos;t want to leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the latest <unk> <unk> workforce in america with our primary bronx of our bronx .
this is a painting from the bronx of the bronx who <unk> kids in his house , not in jail , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
if you add large children with little <unk> , they &apos;re the big fat man in the middle , which is cool , and they &apos;re creating this responsibility among <unk> , which is incredible .
now you might wonder about these children .
hold kids out of those stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who <unk> south bronx
secondly , i &apos;m going to suggest that even as <unk> , there is a rising component of oxytocin on this sharp line , right after this sharp line .
10 : sisyphus suffered a heart attack from a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches , who &apos;s an aura <unk> , have a band with <unk> neurons -- in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have failed , and we need a <unk> team . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- is being used for the treatment of other drugs .
in the case of taking cases , in the hopes of <unk> <unk> in the hopes of fatty <unk> , who <unk> the poor patients with the poor patients of pity .
and five and a half years ago , four from five of clubs were five of the united states in ushahidi , which means &quot; <unk> , &quot; also <unk> .
where are you supposed to know what this is important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i did it the first time <unk> to bring it here .
these people in the middle of the rug call me <unk> , because they &apos;re really left out of the process , you know .
they tried to use connexions as a platform to develop their lives , and <unk> <unk> , which teach them in 84 countries around the world .
yes , books , by which perhaps 100 or 1,000 , are sold in the year .
it doesn &apos;t surprised everybody like it , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very difficult .
the days of <unk> are over when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to see three or four of this country in our country to see how it works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a couple thousand children with two preconditions .
so this is something like an electronic book .
everyone says it &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and this is the <unk> .
they click on things and rigid screens on screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we all play &quot; i love peter , &quot; on a big line , from information , and we can &apos;t keep up with it .
thank you very much .
i think most people think that a hiv infected mother , always their child <unk> .
that &apos;s not possible . this is not .
it &apos;s all good . you &apos;re going to live .
first of all to prevent the <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mentor came to me and told me a story .
how do you create a better health care system ?
the main system is just how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance at the age of four to 22 years , you take a look at what this chart is . it &apos;s <unk> in early youth .
the idea that her father was singing in the public was enough to <unk> her .
this is the silicon building we built together .
after the first year , it became taken from the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i am happy to say that there stayed there , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but during the night , as we walked out , i asked the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> decided they would kiss sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in <unk> .
honestly , i have no idea what it was with <unk> itself , but they &apos;re incredibly complicated .
the first thing you remember when you realize is the terrible force of the processor .
it &apos;s just my leg to lift me up again , bringing myself into a vehicle , and i can get into a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years is the end of our immediate contact <unk> with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for the memory , but our brains are not perfect as technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i would like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you , corn is everything contained in everything else .
you know , in every community , the number of households already grow a lot .
i &apos;ve got three main points of antarctica into antarctica .
but tell me where they are lying and what country they are . &quot;
we &apos;re also exploring the surface of the islands -- a very important habitat for birds , one of the most important mountains in the pacific ocean .
and we as the rest of the world are facing a problem .
he quotes the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open lake <unk> , and the open lake <unk> , and the <unk> that everybody likes to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific pacific , with giant bluefin giant bluefin giant bluefin tuna .
now there &apos;s <unk> , immediate , automatic <unk> system for free of our equipment , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no straightforward scars on it , but if you &apos;re a big bang , they say , &quot; well , what do you tell us the data ? &quot;
instead , he has been very carefully documented , which is what happens again when technology comes into an environment and in a community .
so there are , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a three-dimensional <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least what it was done to me .
now , there was a question of course , which was a question for me in my head : well , i can do more of the things that i like to do in the design , and less of those i don &apos;t pretend to do in the design , and less of the ones i don &apos;t like to do with it ?
and here &apos;s it on the front .
they &apos;re faced with a terrible situation without the direction .
they &apos;re going to hospitals into hospitals .
for example , as <unk> , for example , i was seen as closely gifted in <unk> , because i knew what i need to do , and i know how to use it , and i can rapidly work with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen that recurring people in so many of my friends , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 80s and nuns are still active , as a homeless , republican , college and doctors and doctors .
christian <unk> , as christian <unk> were made out of <unk> <unk> , designed young american men in the united states and canada &apos;s batman and superman who were complaining about the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> of europe , europe of europe .
the largest evil guy , <unk> , doesn &apos;t want these bricks themselves , so they try to prevent them from scratch .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article come out ? &quot;
<unk> : there &apos;s something to do that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group is self-aware .
<unk> <unk> : from islam <unk> superheroes
let &apos;s look at it .
let me wrap it up for you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing myself , i discovered something weird about myself .
so you have the eye , and then comes from the concepts .
but , of course china also has a tremendous population .
but what this demonstrates is , is that this type of visualization of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure of dealing with them because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is named after the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows you to work less .
now for a few months of searching , i discovered there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , which is exactly the same .
this is the basis for the device that these two people built from ford .
they made it -- and it just smell like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things are happening in the way that i want you to pay attention .
and she had no idea of the context in which she was resigned .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye , not my mom , nor my father , my sister , my sister , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my cousins , my name , my cousins , my dear , no .
i report from it , reporting it to say that i had two things i did when i left the orphanage i wanted to do , which was one of my family , and the other thing was to write poems .
and this is how we search for them .
and then you hope that one of us is walking around us and small pieces of stuff .
he had to have a <unk> , and therefore , <unk> team of others , female and likely , had been added a lot of deaths to reach his age of age .
is it a great evolutionary adaptation , and will it happen to be that we will be obtained the hominids that exists on the planet earth ?
but are we going to do this , or will we take nature into nature ?
one day later , a few weeks later , i was with my <unk> in a <unk> store for <unk> , and i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a nuclear plan planned .
that was a basic change for me .
my hint : about 70,000 layers of take this , <unk> <unk> .
so , you know , how am i really obsessed with this ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far from ebay to a chinese newspaper from <unk> to <unk> the bird &apos;s bird for it .
when we went down to the largest extreme blue twigs in the west from a diplomat , it was a perfect <unk> : beauty , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again again , just with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember that my dad took me out in the wheelchair , and i was moved from the top to the bottom , and i felt for the first time the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to lay yourself beside you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was enough to me , and i called the flight school , and i called the flight pilot , and i said i &apos;d like to borrow a <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mom and dad and dad ? were never up up .
i am in this world , but i do work in my work .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> piano flying through a richard serra .
like hell , i &apos;m going to make a phone in three weeks when i have these things evolved over millions of years ?
each of those elements could you hang on in the wall as a kind of incubation .
in his days , he was the ultimate <unk> in british .
so , i look at the spills and what they &apos;re looking like -- how they push themselves and tiles . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the ritz-carlton . it &apos;s been made from aluminum , as opposed to the aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you put it in contemporary architecture , it feels like me , of course , of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
right after i graduated from my dr. , i was lucky enough to be a member of the <unk> who used it for the first time to explore the oceans .
there was one of those <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to look at animals that are blind to the red light light , and you can see them without being seen .
so they use it to go and find mates .
i &apos;m asking them to give me another science of science that still used hundreds of old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i went on to rediscover the value of consciousness .
and on the fifth of june 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the glass that lived my life , and it &apos;s a duck named one duck .
and here &apos;s the chickens again .
after the costs , my life changed .
another example of the effects of birds on the life of birds .
so , for example , i mean something -- this is the tone for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear with the food and write music .
one of them is &quot; martin luther king &quot; by martin luther king , and the others is from hitler .
now , you can see that there &apos;s a lot more often , that the former <unk> is now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that can be used to be used by rescue . &quot;
absolutely boggles absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers don &apos;t want order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
so , it &apos;s very , very freedom of structure .
because life is complex . and this is the largest and biggest change : we must restore authority to the interpretation of it , and i think we must restore the authority to the <unk> and <unk> .
a free society takes red light and green lights , and otherwise she will remain complete a complete standstill .
<unk> boundaries for the interest to calculate the <unk> , by the charges you can take .
now , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to round columns columns with a ruler .
he had a very badly compensation workplace .
he had only one of them at the end of the day .
but the problem with rules and incentives , in addition to them , is because it lacks the professional activity , and they <unk> the professional performance in two ways .
so smart <unk> is better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to make sure that some intelligent <unk> can sustain that for forever .
why has this idea spreading ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to look at the mentality now with a little bit more closely that we -- america and the rest of the world -- had had done .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we have to do it with a full <unk> .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport for 34 pounds is to transport uranium uranium .
what if they hadn &apos;t had nuclear weapon ?
we come down and bring the truck you just saw somewhere here .
part of the problem is that the <unk> themselves are , deeply , from the thought of a nuclear catastrophe .
it was sent to me from someone who &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , in fact , that it had america .
there &apos;s a lot of black sheep out there who are doing the wrong things , and the problems have even more repressive .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous conversation .
imagine if we could , because if we could , we could reach more .
and the government , most of the progress , are the resources that have found resources , &quot; shared value , &quot; business value in business , rather than the government to see the government .
maybe i can cut here , i can look at the brain , and i can change my hand .
i &apos;d like to kind of zoom in .
get into the 19th century with me in the 19th century , fully closely june 24th of june .
we certainly could all be productive if facebook or twitter won &apos;t cost us as well as facebook or twitter .
they went out into the u.k. government fundraiser to get money to build money , because they believed that these machines were going to have enormous practical impact for society .
those benefits were not only allowed to be fewer wealthy men doing research , but they &apos;re also starting to go beyond the <unk> , instead of just answering <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
so once you look at the very small things -- this person has written a whole article , and they said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and everyone who &apos;s not old enough , they have no idea what this infection happened -- they have these <unk> .
there &apos;s about 10,000 programs in there .
this would be the <unk> in which one of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one from random elected monkeys can find out written in one by random text .
anywhere where life is , you will have that distribution , as opposed to this distribution .
hot hot , hot hot hot hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost this guy ? &quot;
so this is the data from a single survey to <unk> in zambia from a couple of years ago , from a couple of years ago that i got <unk> .
as you see , bruce willis had a lot more hair at that time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 100,000 dollars , if i had at all the time , or it was fit in my plan , and i was not just on vacation .
instead of teach people how to extract the paper on the cell phone , we should develop software that allows you to do it yourself without practice without practice .
that &apos;s less than me at the time when i went to two weeks as a <unk> .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life , in life , we need to change the height .
this can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
so i promised myself that next time i would be flying around the world , i &apos;m going to have no fuel take , independent from fossil fuels to be threatened , not to be threatened by the united states .
so , i think you need a pilot on the airplane who can talk to universities who can talk to students who can talk to students , who can actually make it a human adventures .
and what is the endgame ?
that &apos;s why all people who think of these intuitions are welcome to be part of this team .
now you need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is , which is this problem , and what it does is it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
so let &apos;s shut down for a second with that nonsense .
the first generation is that we can see the first generation and the extreme poverty in the eyes , look at the oceans , say it , and we don &apos;t have to stand there .
it &apos;s one on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the <unk> states who said , and look at the history of the world .
people find it out slowly .
and with that one campaign as we have our teammates , my organization , and other groups have the energy and the supply of the <unk> of hollywood to go from hollywood to into greenland from america .
step forward : step ahead , a nurse , a teacher , a stay-at-home mom , will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all its life , can change a country -- and a continent that has just done so much , depending on a continent of it -- inflationary my mind .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
and your job is to see what these shapes are bouba , and what kiki does .
now , if you &apos;re not just shutting down now , that sentence , literally took off , false .
when we solve a problem or something new , we do what we already think about what we already know about ourselves , what we don &apos;t know about us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t fit in to fit in all these masterpieces .
pm : i don &apos;t think .
how do you handle it , you personally , but with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
this clearly demonstrates a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three and size .
this is one side of the side side effects : if you &apos;re eating too much salt like this , like a baking <unk> and <unk> sandwich , you might end up with the <unk> .
but soon , i was able to see <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i &apos;d probably never seen my home again .
i sat there , and i was ecstatic with the <unk> for transplants , and i asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant group to prepare me for it .
i was hanging out on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you very much .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is also <unk> in the united states for 200 percent .
and also interesting , the same companies that we sell about the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and now sold the drug to the drug -- one and the same company .
so we launched also as <unk> .
what would our kids say to us , if you look at a child every day , i had a little bit more <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little bit of <unk> a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , this ties .
here you see the chief <unk> <unk> adjacent to the airport from los angeles .
i &apos;m offering five cents for each <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , and it has become global .
you see here , in red , the spread of the decline .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the base of an elephant looking at a elephant &apos;s foot , and the largest part of them sticks with them .
they look like this out of their <unk> and hail from all directions around us .
redwoods have an enormous surface that stretches out into the sky , because they tend to have something called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> of the <unk> resilience , just like a cathedral , and helps the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s perfectly cliché to see that .
but since recently , all the doors of books have vanished and the walls are breaking down .
it was 25 years ago .
so , for example , first of all , let &apos;s look at the <unk> tree .
what do these people then do with those smart computers ?
and you can see what we &apos;re working on trying to work -- like <unk> &apos;s work -- and try to find a way , the <unk> that we meet with .
they &apos;re going to see that they &apos;re going down there at the bottom there -- <unk> / d. / <unk> , and if you open this image image on your computer image on your computer , then this program will blossom .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the artist &apos;s <unk> is .
we have to make sure that everything is going to make sure that all the games are missing , even if the computers goes out .
but i have nothing to do with it .
that person surrounds himself with advisers .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these forces disappeared completely , no one <unk> by 2011 .
it would be good when people were <unk> , and these kinds of calculations are serious and they would participate , because these things would change things , but it would change things in two ways .
so that means that we recognize a copy of themselves when they &apos;re used just a bit of the <unk> that happens in slow motion , that in slow motion and <unk> .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their <unk> , and they saw that their videos had suddenly spreading out like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what he was taught to do when he was five years old .
and i &apos;m appreciative of the fact that i had a mentor like to be a leader of how to survive .
what is it that is focused on today today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and what you &apos;re going to do it ?
didn &apos;t -- it didn &apos;t -- it didn &apos;t -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t have the right manager .
at that moment , you know , deliberate or unconscious . the moment you <unk> , you can zoom in on something , and whatever it does , it means to make sense of emotion .
do you ever have done , and went out afterwards : &quot; i was ! &quot;
to death as well . so , god in his never-ending wisdom gave us another human desire : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true , we need it . we can do it by intimacy , through friendship , through prayer , by moves through nature in nature .
and there &apos;s seven different beliefs , i can &apos;t tell you , because i am . the last element is emotion .
in fact , enrico guy in <unk> territory , someone in new york , who would have died if he had been working on the work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist , and he said quite clearly .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools where a large number of people can tell stories anywhere in the world .
the color of the particles are like feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
and we see , &quot; i feel like i was on the computer all day . &quot;
and when i go over here , it starts opening the list , and there are thousands of feelings that are collected .
ten commandments radiation , and we wrap the time capsule time .
it says , &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
so , we can click on this and see this iconic image of the betty of her husband , as she kissing her husband &apos;s grandfather .
you can also look at quotes if you want to read a quotes to change in climate change .
so , people feel more resistant than something that is in the way .
in life . it has tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries around the world .
they only need one step outside , and to pay attention to that , which is so common , so common , so banal , everyone else is overlooked .
so look up , you admire the <unk> beauty , and you always think it &apos;s going to keep your mind in the clouds .
they &apos;d have 25,000 recordings that used 25,000 recordings that would have done this , &quot; <unk> , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the pottery to buy my first gear , and it was a big machine .
these are images from a virtual autopsy table .
so you can see how the knife is penetrated in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , who &apos;s in his interior , very , very short .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he does it .
so , very talented people .
i went out with the kids as often as possible , to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
it isn &apos;t yet yet , but it &apos;s an incredibly poetic summary of everything we know about the nature of nature .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think about the universe , but it comes from mathematics and tries to try to explain physics that we know .
but in the course of my career , but always something into me .
in 2001 , i attended them during 2001 .
we got lots of <unk> .
this is , after the first graduated in 2004 , in 2004 .
he &apos;s just been filmed in front of the sunday meeting , and i was filmed with someone you all know .
and each one will be <unk> , but in different scientific discipline , are being specialized in different scientific discipline .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really cool device .
he studies the brain using mri , and he says , &quot; this is the most amazing brain he &apos;s ever scanned .
i &apos;m going to tell you about the next few slides that i &apos;m going to tell you about .
transistors are getting smaller to allow this , and this has done our technology significantly better .
we &apos;re behind this lens behind this lens .
i felt like a gut gut that we felt it was wrong .
so , in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
so we can see that in our galaxy , we can see more detail than anything else .
and that takes us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there there .
it pulls a lot more stronger than the other and the cloud will spit apart .
and i hope at least that i &apos;m at least convinced that we have a really supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and one day i traveled on in the streets of new york and saw some children between stairs and cars and fire <unk> .
so for example , the people in the 11th <unk> bits who ended up carrying this .
for the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what &quot; in the spirit of appreciating , and at the awards .
through new and powerful instrumentation , the age of <unk> .
but a question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and emotion over time
so we &apos;re at the dawn of a new <unk> .
in 1945 , 1945 , it took a 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , even though i don &apos;t know where to begin .
wow , one volunteers , great !
but recently , my interests has been focused on trying to look at a new perspective on a new vision , because there are context where there can be something really cool .
well , i think this is the most fundamental development phenomenon of phenomenon we call crowd-accelerated innovation .
but the element of the ecstasy is really the most important .
we get phenomenal from them .
now , let me think about this , sam <unk> .
but even if you look at the screen , there &apos;s a lot more communicated than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s going right now .
so how <unk> diffusion of innovation values worldwide .
first : i have to be as a member of the audience to make a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him to do instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re going to be fun at designing their own , ultimate , or <unk> tedtalk .
now , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive , and they give them sugar , as a kind of <unk> , which we call the superpower .
so , these kinds of tests are used , ok ?
someone asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three major changes in transparency in transparency , choice , choice , where people have a real power .
what do we do ?
my favorite , <unk> <unk> , says , all over the world , exist more photos from your back than anyone else .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , <unk> , <unk> teachers and surveys , as employees as helpful resources , because they took on specific areas in which they use a lot of sense .
so then i wish everyone a beautiful weekend .
dna to read and write , becomes always simpler and cheaper .
<unk> work on his own .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
so if you look around the world like this , it can lead to a biotechnology company , who allows you to create biotechnology .
the kingdom says , his legislation allows him , outsiders <unk> , or <unk> , which is an economic risk or an asset or a risk for health care or the <unk> of the state .
and these laws are a gateway to the face of science , and are based on prejudice and ignorance and abuse of traditions and selected <unk> .
why are you pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one from 10 <unk> people with people who are injecting drugs .
so that social , spreading out condoms at risk messaging , not being advised by the police , scolded , or randomly become locked in .
here were children born , people were born there .
office buildings for personal work are already obsolete now .
they get eliminated , the road <unk> , the river down below the streets , and you get charged by one end to the other , without borders .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny homes . &quot;
also jobs should be shared .
and her liver , <unk> oil .
and they were killing the 12,000 sharks at the time , just by putting a <unk> out of <unk> bay in achill bay on achill island in achill island .
we know very little about them .
so it turns out that this is a place on a shark scale , depending on the time and sunset , the water and the sunset .
so if we look at the <unk> <unk> , what we &apos;ve done with the genes , we can see that basking sharks , compared with the first study , have dropped ten less diversity than others .
so refined in this research and found out that the size of it is about the size of it .
and what was wrong . we were getting there . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can determine the sex of the shark , before we take a sample sample , we can tell the geneticists if they were from one male or a female .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
and their bodies are being combined with <unk> splitting , and they &apos;re being used to be used for making money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no businesses did no business .
my journalism likes on other continents , or in other countries , not fit , in my part of africa , but he &apos;s working on corruption , ask people to ask people : &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> dynasty .
i wouldn &apos;t be known as <unk> <unk> .
and , had these people had ever met an victims of their <unk> ?
today , you can see in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of his sexuality , because of its sexuality , because of its sexuality .
at some point , i realize my mission &quot; gay &quot; was flawed , because there had been a million of different statements from being gay .
at least i hope that it will become more difficult , human rights rights .
first , the world is , and it will always contain good and evil , because good and evil , and yang and yang are the <unk> .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 images that had taken the soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing way is true .
so , this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust have come , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my sir , who is responsible when it &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
stanley milgram , by the way , both 1954 , graduated from high school , by the james <unk> in the bronx of james mckinley in the bronx .
here &apos;s the chief party with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of the others . <unk> of himself .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil by the heart of every human being .
and i did the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anybody could do , &quot; no big deal on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that really was very difficult to make .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , there &apos;s a <unk> scrolling line that is tagged by the red arrow points .
there &apos;s only one tetrahedron , which is the body .
i promise i &apos;m not saying anything to it , except that it was supposed to be depressing .
and autobiographical self holds ancient memory , thinking creativity creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for a house -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you -- i &apos;m going to tell you about this -- i &apos;m going to tell you about feminism , because i think feminism has partly the job , admit , aesthetic , and joy and fun .
we don &apos;t want a big hero .
now , you can see now , i haven &apos;t put myself on fire .
she was talking about <unk> , she founded <unk> , she founded her <unk> friends , she <unk> friends -- all these daily practices of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s these <unk> , which is homo sapiens from ancient <unk> from ancient <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain , which is reading the electrical activity in my brain while i &apos;m holding this talk .
we &apos;re <unk> numerous prototypes and products to live with ideas that you can control with thoughts , like appliances appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
as these children are able to use their new conscious conscious consciousness , many of the detrimental , <unk> social <unk> , whose people who are being detected as others are being detected themselves differently .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value that we refer to people , is changing rapidly and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my options .
temporary , and quite unexpected , they gave up .
that specialist didn &apos;t stopped looking at my eyes .
i walked a distance i knew .
and quite slowly it happened slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in me , didn &apos;t really believe in all the <unk> from me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole i .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same thing , but one of them feel great about it , and with the other , with just a small change in the posture , they feel dreadful .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to take place to control the degree of control that we have on our board .
for <unk> percent of these money , they could install <unk> in the 2020s , which hadn &apos;t reduced the duration of the journey , but what the enjoyment and the usefulness would have improved well .
i &apos;m not going to ask about the entire topic of one thing about the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the problem in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as <unk> discipline to human psychology .
have the average answer to 50 percent in 50 percent .
it turns out they &apos;re not going to hurt themselves , they don &apos;t even hurt themselves themselves .
yay ! yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that wouldn &apos;t mean that i had a coin head on two sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our view of the visible universe .
thank you .
in hyperscore , we had g.m. good enough , in fact , very powerfully effects with children all over the world , and now people all ages of age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> button that he has composed entirely in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , do we make a <unk> . &quot;
so , first of all , the present self is the present .
i have to write five pages on the day writing books , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that it &apos;s going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is , the last <unk> machine machine , is something that i did with hal <unk> , who was explained by my co-author on a previous project , bill <unk> .
and it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not influenced by human beings because one of the faces smiles , and then the other face is watching the other face of frowning .
so that &apos;s one of the reasons that we think about western science , mathematics and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> centuries of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown thing , because in spanish , there isn &apos;t a sh .
so it surprised that if you talk about mental illness , you &apos;re talking about mental illness , you &apos;re likely to hear stories , shame and discrimination in almost all of the spheres of life .
a little more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world in <unk> and gave us the legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve already heard of fish .
if you look closely at this rainfall , you &apos;ll see that there are almost 8,000 of these dollars in fact .
it was in the early stages when india was going to double his <unk> <unk> -- as a drug to recovery -- to china with its <unk> growth from eight , nine , 10 percent , and wondered : why can &apos;t we do it ?
that &apos;s not a good situation , but you have the trust , and the guts , and say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , which is the emissions from deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon forming together 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what those things mean , dick included not -- by a chance not too .
and i also liked these intellectual leaders too .
and he said , he had essentially had the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t have to go through the process , they don &apos;t necessarily have to worry about how they move .
we removed the entire stuff , and the <unk> color , which is just sucking these simple fantastic images .
many of these ideas put together in the producing trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your kids will come to the tinkering school , they will come out with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but they drag them under their own <unk> , and trust me , they &apos;re learning things they cannot learn from the <unk> dialectic .
if you want to just throw out a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s everything . it &apos;s number <unk> . ok .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife is moving forward , four months later , in aspen , four months after that , in aspen , and good constitution .
how about a totally gratuitous <unk> , not just sharing it ?
this is one from the seven remaining <unk> who didn &apos;t get shot into space .
and so , in fact , it went out to buy fully western europe <unk> , first thousands , and then hundreds of thousands and millions of pieces of each of us to add a little piece of paper that was supposed to put together in the sky .
but how does our imagination ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
and as a light bulb , it looked like something like this .
you must be pretty smart , and even though i haven &apos;t got a <unk> , doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m dumb , because you can &apos;t be dumb and put it in the world .
they literally have the door <unk> .
so , if you listen to the <unk> menu of your <unk> listening , both ears of ears either .
and we have the problem that the antenna breaks down .
thank you very much .
from that reason , i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i was coloring for every person on her own special map , and i wrote her name on it , <unk> her , and she sent her out .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s earth-like , my valuable and limited life on this planet earth .
in that mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell myself a little bit about how nature creates compounds .
let &apos;s think about future technology , we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it periodically , you see the amino acids , the amino acids , where they have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can get one out of one billion fish , which is what you want to do , like , for example , a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see <unk> coming out .
so if you ask people the question : where do you go from doing something important ?
i sat on my desk , i used my expensive computers .
what happens -- sometimes you get those days when you wake up eight a.m. in morning , or at least seven or when you &apos;re getting up , and you &apos;re saying , oh , man , i don &apos;t really enjoy .
in the office , most of the <unk> and distractions that actually prevent people from doing work from work .
we all know that it &apos;s true . you would never encounter a <unk> meeting that &apos;s going to happen by employees .
so , meetings and managers are now the two main main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe two weeks , one week , one week , one week , one week , one week at which nobody wants to talk .
you know , i &apos;m going to look at this , i &apos;m going to do this for seven years now , and i have no idea what the future will look like .
but if you ask people about the three most important thing they have to do with -- no matter what culture , depending on what the culture and what context -- says most people , is : keys , money , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big one , but we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent discount , and then -- the owner of this is taking 10 or 20 percent discount , depending on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he &apos;s kind of an recognition of the values from <unk> .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;ll later talk about later .
what were we talking about right now ?
dean ornish shares our new findings , which show how the <unk> of healthy societies can change a human level . he says , for example , that if we live healthier , better food , exercise more than they can actually multiply our brain cells .
until i tell you who said it .
within that framework , we obviously can &apos;t feel regret about a lot of different things .
when i went home on the evening , after i got my own tattoo , i stayed nearly the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s still one fifth grade .
i mean , even the dumb answer of all of the &quot; <unk> can come back to ted days for days . &quot;
and as i used to say , i have a pottery .
i thought i would try to try and try to check my ted wish i would try to do what i try to do , and how to try to do what they try to do .
no in india . now , there &apos;s at least one half a million active active .
and then the notion that someone in this whole troubled world has to think about the <unk> world of <unk> .
and so we decided to do that .
listen to this : less than four percent of one percent of one percent of those who were treated , they used to drop the bonuses of their drug , or <unk> their treatment .
it &apos;s worth mentioning , and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> aren &apos;t <unk> .
if the <unk> is used , they will produce 5,000 watt electricity , day and night .
and people put their green business , hopefully , hopefully , green restaurants , with green school in green school .
so ordinary women in bali cooking food , and they use secrets that only accompanies their grandmothers .
we need someone who &apos;s come and study this .
green school is a model we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal chords , were still healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
and then apple alex took out , the best voice i had .
there was one reason for this : i was .
the <unk> , of course , is not natural markings .
but it &apos;s not about that .
at first , the internet for me was a nurturing tool , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave on for my real life , everyday life .
it &apos;s human being to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing turing test .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me once , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you feel ? &quot;
so , we treated two <unk> pages as a single side , because this is what the readers are .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not running out of it .
it was <unk> and terrible things happened with me .
everyone lost hope in my healing .
so they went to their <unk> , and everybody gathered their <unk> furniture -- they gave me pots and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
they don &apos;t know how far away this street , and they don &apos;t know if they go straight and they hear cars , and they had a terrible accident that they were able to do .
i thought that for whatever reason had stayed , and only for family and friends have gone extinct .
so , for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we &apos;d discovered every symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t flip it , because i have built a little hurdle , doesn &apos;t it ?
if i chop a magic match , and then one turns out there &apos;s a third one .
galois has set up a series of rules about how these tables , these symmetries , they interact .
one of those kind of symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of calling all the mess , i &apos;d like to know how many digits do the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects have basically -- symmetrical objects -- please spell it for me .
one : worse nutrition , maybe shorter levels .
thomas edison have worked today in a software company today .
and penicillin was discovered in 1928 , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and medically useful doses of it .
it was the source of <unk> , who had his 50th anniversary year .
and for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that it &apos;s going to happen now , and we &apos;re doing the best of it .
it works with every computer and browser -- negatives , negatives , negatives and text .
they don &apos;t need to lock them either way too .
and so , there &apos;s kind of a kind of food that i &apos;m going to get inspired by , my true desk .
so , one of the things about it would be kind of like a <unk> thing , so that you can get back to the more traditional thing , and things are being consumed in grid .
now , i get into my music &apos;s heart , and there &apos;s no borders of the people and there &apos;s no borders .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with the bite . and with such a bite , i want to suggest the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just miners , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are now 90,000 physicists on wall street today , and i am one of them . &quot;
so you can find here , this is a book about flying you , which you might leaked on amazon .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can get it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
here &apos;s it . shake . wow !
i &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without lights , so with <unk> , saving a lot of life , save a lot of them , but there &apos;s a lot more upstream of them .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the road .
warren buffet was supposed to say , honestly , what &apos;s going on and what doesn &apos;t work to do to make a annual thing .
in fact , what we &apos;re seeing is that it &apos;s the only known thing , because of living living in africa , that &apos;s the only thing we &apos;ve seen out there in africa .
this means the economy in these areas , because it simply prevents so much .
but there isn &apos;t even yet there is no more drastic .
not only she was weak ; she gets weaker .
a teacher from top quartile is the average of his classroom -- measured by <unk> -- in one year by 10 percent .
but it doesn &apos;t have any relationship to be a better teachers .
what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can do some <unk> anywhere , so everyone can use access to a <unk> solution , so everyone can have access to the very best teachers .
traditional fur , like this cups , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a painter and he used to go to his school in florence .
when i look at these photos , i put myself back my clothes on my clothes when i went home to my family .
my parents challenged great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow tomorrow .
but it is so bad to keep us as powerful as powerfully ?
this is general general in boston .
and the pathologist is going to take the sample , put it in , <unk> it , put it under the microscope , and then shifted it under the microscope , and then it turns the operating theater .
so in this case , a solution adds up with these <unk> molecules , mixed with a dye here , with a dye here , in the <unk> of one cancer scan of cancer patients , can &apos;t separate those molecules .
with <unk> lymph node as part of what our teammates is based on , the surgeon is looking at the number of nodes , the lymph node , where the cancer begins .
if nerves will be damage , they can cause paralysis , pain .
if we put those two samples together ...
we know that this is feasible and we are determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different parts we learn from .
it will change the normal circuits in the same way that the sick people they want to fix .
and one in the middle of the summer in 2004 , we have unveiled it and it didn &apos;t work for the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that there &apos;s already a brief <unk> of these cells to learn from learning .
and it &apos;s going on . now .
i want to just end with a story from which we think might be a clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually comes down the walls and opens up the little platform and can use his eyes again .
buildings are more connected in the air , <unk> microbes that span through the window and through mechanical <unk> .
and if you &apos;re out there , then the air contains microbes that are associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i am a physically strong person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t have a worry about this thing .
the same for the question , who after 9 / 11 was the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of those things that i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and search for google afterwards , and then you search in these results after the name of someone .
this is britney spears . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you &apos;ll link one most .
what for us , 40 years ago , was norman -- reporting stories between generations of generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than the most <unk> of our members of our members .
was the story good telling ?
why don &apos;t we see this vision of the same passion as it read ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send them out of a <unk> , &quot; this product contains chemicals that will be seen from the state of california as the cause of cancer , <unk> , and others will be seen . &quot;
so perhaps we could develop a <unk> solution to the humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s been an accident that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; ancient &quot; since &quot; the mama &quot; and &quot; the march &quot; since &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t know whether they remember his response , but it was , &quot; the stone did not end , because we are out of slavery . &quot;
and this may be pretty well for berlin , but we &apos;re building <unk> on houston , and all the windows are closed , and with all the products that obviously haven &apos;t been designed for the use of cars , which is actually a vertical rarity .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since then , we &apos;ve selected the 4,000 pollinators ever since we have a database that we &apos;re going to put on in six weeks of public health .
now we &apos;ve got 160 pounds of heavy processing production on the internet in the internet .
we started commercial and <unk> from buildings to integrate buildings so that all people could have centers and places where they can stay out .
and this is <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you about anybody knowing that we knew everything that we knew , because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , these <unk> <unk> at microsoft at 9 / 11 in 2007 launched the yahoo on march 12th and then the others : google , facebook , whatever , apple and so on .
i selected sweden , because sweden has the same laws as the united states .
and whoever told them that they have nothing to conceal out about it , just haven &apos;t spent a lot of time thinking about it .
and they read their emails , and she said , in the <unk> and said , &quot; if there isn &apos;t a rule in privacy , there cannot be real freedoms , and therefore can &apos;t be sustainable democracy . &quot;
a lot of people , when you first see a fresh brain of your brain , say , &quot; usually look different if you &apos;re going to show a brain . &quot;
all of these empty areas , are the areas where these lines go through these lines .
and the thing is , from a certain cell , to make it practical , is to determine what the 25,000 genes are turned on , and what are they turned on to be turned on to be turned on .
now , experts are approaching the game , and they make basic <unk> <unk> .
we take the <unk> material , and we put it on something called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at the entire genome and they &apos;re trying to figure out what they &apos;re doing with genes connected with genes .
whether from your individual genetic cortex or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to fix poverty , we have to do something more about it ?
so here are some more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all the same .
and it &apos;s done a lot of experiments that everybody leads to the same conclusion , so i &apos;m only going to talk about one .
so what is the best ?
we need that kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to guide politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , with things where we are sure you &apos;re going to make it .
poverty is more substantial than scientific work , and a lack of data about the implications of <unk> , and a lack of data about the implications of leadership , but <unk> esther duflo talked to , it &apos;s been able to figure out how to help and do the damage -- with careful studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , the way that we look at it in a certain way .
and legend reported that alexander walked through this desert .
but you might say , &quot; invest in africa with over 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t be moving . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and the specific materials and data .
i want to discuss this from the perspective of the <unk> .
in tanzania , last week was the standard for <unk> <unk> .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what did you think in 2025 in 2025 , &apos; what was happening in 2025 ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there are intriguing possibilities .
&quot; god is the journey that we all want to be inspired to be inspired by and feel at the universe with the universe .
you put a light switch on -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they did .
i &apos;m going to make that kind of stuff , so i &apos;m going to describe it , and i &apos;m going to describe my response when i first saw that .
absolutely exactly .
ok , change them , raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i look only on the streets .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
let &apos;s go again again .
kb : how often did they feel felt ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , two , one .
only if you want pressure to release , you make a tetrahedron , so , but only if you want the pressure released .
do you want to try it ?
so you feel a specific sensation , and if you feel the sensation , i &apos;d like you to drop the <unk> into the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing i &apos;d like to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . so you think he &apos;s here , yes or no ?
so , first of all , it &apos;s keith barry , like our brain imaging system -- with a trick that works with our bodies -- with a trick of it , and then he engaged the audience in some amazing <unk> brain regions of brain brain brain regions .
<unk> me .
this is not for one of four . this is for every four .
i saw that both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost at zero unless there is no stimulation in the <unk> .
and then they get this message from the computer : &quot; one one has sent them a lot of money .
we found that the effect of oxytocin increases the generosity from <unk> to 80 percent .
i only found that molecule found .
he asked me again , &quot; what are we going to do ? &quot;
in experimental studies , we have told testosterone testosterone .
this tells us we invented this ritual to unite us into this new couple of emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to motivate your brain to <unk> .
to make the device run , you need a lot , a lot of people .
or shouldn &apos;t you do it about it ?
and they said quite <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ve given a device that works only in english , and so we have taught ourselves english , so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to break my own argument by making a ridiculous statement .
it &apos;s ridiculous , but i needed to follow the victorian norm .
how will tomorrow be ?
we &apos;ve got to undo that imbalance , from danger to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s exactly the focus on it right there .
i asked a lot of incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how do you end ? &quot; -- by nine-year-old .
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next song , because i &apos;ve lost totally the spell .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found that he had moved in the official official officer as dead .
therefore , this area is <unk> .
<unk> is at the top layer , which is able to take multiple numbers of numbers and thousands of households , usual .
and after those four children , you see <unk> younger sister who followed her children , who have been killed .
and eventually , there was one person who sat down for me , and later his involvement was brought back , and later , i had to <unk> it , so it had to be <unk> .
at 16 , the children have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t get nowhere anywhere .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of the blank hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could spend a little bit longer !
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from him , the sound comes through the box .
or , or we &apos;re doing this , and this is what blindness is .
rain . no bad . no bad .
<unk> <unk> . but why can &apos;t i do that when i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this <unk> fey &apos;s dove , the dove <unk> evelyn <unk> , why the music of music is much more likely to make melodies than sound waves on his eardrum .
and it was so big , until the point where it became a <unk> last year at <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving , rick <unk> and rick <unk> and <unk> million people on tv .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing .
cp : you &apos;re lucky that it &apos;s not going to be distributed to them .
peace and love .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what you &apos;re supposed to do .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their peak size , and flattening all those habitats .
we look at the dinosaurs very , very unusual in our bodies .
basically , it &apos;s a country that doesn &apos;t originate in the beginning of our work .
this is an adult cancer <unk> in his hindquarters .
paul never seen a fossil way .
these are all <unk> . there are a series of options .
i became artists and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been dealing with this question for centuries -- about centuries -- how to bring these children in science .
there &apos;s a bad news for derartu tulu turns out the same idea , including the athlete , paula radcliffe , paula radcliffe , paula radcliffe at all times the fastest <unk> of all times .
show me an animal with <unk> and gills , it has something to do with water .
we didn &apos;t use our physical strength , because we have the largest <unk> in the brain imaging .
now , emily <unk> -- one from 500 <unk> and <unk> -- it ends up in the eighth position , under the best 10 , though they &apos;ve done their baby to <unk> her baby &apos;s baby , and <unk> <unk> &apos;s <unk> runners from her baby .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s going to look at the focus on that level that you have failed when it takes four hours to do it .
in robotics , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not in a social way , which is , of course , for us , and people really would help to accept robots as part of our daily life .
monster &apos;s monster is very , very bad .
the <unk> was a <unk> of our group in which they used three different technology to interacting with the participants .
and with this technology , you can actually become active participants in the lives of their grandchildren , in a way , like it today &apos;s not possible .
and the third way to make a simple journal of paper , and pen , because this is the <unk> you usually used when you &apos;re a zombie and a <unk> .
another important idea is this notion of <unk> <unk> of the character .
i have met , so , you know , this is really tough , because it &apos;s not going to go down , you know , &quot; <unk> &apos;s going to be an n of . &quot;
and go out , don &apos;t get too far . i say , &quot; satan , &quot; the <unk> falls between two <unk> cars .
when he was writing in a conversational press , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and photographs , but i &apos;m also doing <unk> , books and a bit of advertising , everything with the same concept .
and from the film becomes these <unk> , they fearless desire and <unk> and whatever you can &apos;t have , you want more .
as you go into consciousness consciousness , without realizing that we all know how to do it , and how it &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you &apos;re changing the picture that he &apos;s shooting at , and suddenly it becomes very serious and perhaps less accessible .
85 percent of the global heart disease is in the developing world -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
just treating it . look at the state of mauritius .
but when you &apos;re told , well , we &apos;re trying to do the same thing in nigeria , and they &apos;re all going on .
it makes the existence <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
and we need to be a part of the solution -- that &apos;s important to us .
and we &apos;re starting a tech program technology program , so we &apos;re targeting local people who can fix the rig .
autism has a very big diversity , from a very mass -- the child has not developed language -- to begin to becoming brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the movie , like all of them <unk> my projects , and that &apos;s the weirdo in me .
now , what i learned later , because i was not so <unk> , my job is to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of the swan .
it &apos;s in the movie called dr <unk> .
i was doing <unk> during graduation , and i set things up and learn how to do tasks , learn how to do tasks .
another very unfortunate idea is to let the kids learn from some of the many <unk> <unk> , and they have to give them en status .
tg : well , i have passion for what i &apos;m doing to make the world better .
it &apos;s a distributed reality , which can link and link systems , or simply a digital storyteller .
the fifth times i stand on this coast , the <unk> <unk> i look out at the far skyline and faith , again , i &apos;m gonna make it all the way through the vast , dangerous wilderness of one ocean .
but it &apos;s going deeper , like a lot of life , there &apos;s still left there ?
and then there is our <unk> , which is never really going to really tell me how far it is , because we don &apos;t really know how far it is .
but honestly , all of these things i had to talk about , just to try to make the <unk> <unk> , they were very different .
thank you very much , much fun at the conference .
and this may be the <unk> , lost his sense of self-worth .
he joins the army . and the army gives him a gun .
so what happens when a medium suddenly brings lots of new ideas into orbit ?
they had to quickly synchronize what other natural philosophers knew , and they couldn &apos;t do the right kinds of argument .
but there was a programmer who decided that it was not the best way of work .
and each of them can do changes , and they can <unk> them from <unk> work , even if they knew nothing about the existence of each other .
this is what you call a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing right here .
something that can happen a culture that can happen , is that they can acquire a new orthodoxy : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , now this is that . right ?
don &apos;t try to improve what others do , because it doesn &apos;t get a lot , because it doesn &apos;t get a lot .
and when someone tells you you can &apos;t do it , then you don &apos;t listen to it .
six to nine months at the lowest seasons of seasons .
but we &apos;ve gone through these rover <unk> before we put them there -- and they made one rover -- and they made sure that everything works .
so we sent a probe on the way to mars , which is phoenix . this probe will end up 17 days , seven seconds and 20 seconds , so you can ask your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re at the while we &apos;re talking about trying to bring the next rover that we &apos;re going to send to mars .
and i know many of you have the last time that these airbags are really cool stuff .
there were two <unk> that we were particularly interested in in particular .
it &apos;s as similar as the circle on the earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it cannot be water because water would be frozen .
today , i want to talk about how these exponentially growing technology are .
so we &apos;re looking at how exponential growing technology is affecting patient health care .
this is one example of this <unk> .
there &apos;s already wireless <unk> .
and i think a lot of these technologies will help us to be connected better with our patients and taking us more time to focus on the important , human elements of medicine , which are augmented by this kinds of technology .
but the latest trend in medicine is to be exponentially small .
if we went to genomics , as 10 years ago , the first human being performed , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to sites like <unk> cups , or <unk> , or <unk> of your data on <unk> shirts , or google health , it will always be more important to use all of these possibilities in a <unk> way .
we used the cells from patient bone marrow to heart disease , to treat a patient with heart disease , we recognized an arsenal of blood , and higher <unk> , depending on the use of your own backyard , <unk> cells on a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; mud . &quot;
your cats , god knows how many who sticks on her childhood , her <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
and as you go through the <unk> tiles , go on to the streets , <unk> , look at me , &quot; can you help me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was terrified of , a <unk> part of me , had taken out of control , and i would always be trapped in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of your <unk> aorta .
but i fear that <unk> come from and show me his hand .
if we love , you hold me around me all around me , i &apos;m there and not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that motivates the attention to critical issues , images that religions are , are crossing to religions , to try and do something in other words , in other words , to act with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the other thing about this illness was a tremendous obstacle to discuss about this disease , or to discuss it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i &apos;d read a lot of books and studied books and studies .
so i couldn &apos;t see how i put the flag on the stick , well , yeah -- <unk> , a <unk> moment , and the music went on for a <unk> .
finally , on the morning of this morning , we got the <unk> team , we got the <unk> , two <unk> in the <unk> , which leads me on the edge of the <unk> .
i knew it had more open water bodies , and i had a <unk> mentality with .
i knew that , but i had something to do .
so this was the view of my tent when i got this nagging phone call .
and just from the air i saw the big picture .
and they went to shore and they wanted to go back to shore , and everyone five died at the time .
and he said a jewish man , and so this is a lot .
but a few days later , we started looking at our students about it , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this <unk> guy wouldn &apos;t be in that condition ?
one day in <unk> calving miles off shore in one of the most most remote regions of the pacific ocean , saw 20 american fees on her ship in the sea floor .
but in a certain point , most of you learn to add those visions , and grow up to adults .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to look at their fears more than others .
right now , fear is a scary gift of imagination , a kind of incubation in everyday life , a way to look at the future in a way that is still time to affect their appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we put them in every living room of the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the crowd , and now we see them crash , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because what we discovered is it took people care , and people want to be adopted -- they receive the internet scans through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i am as 22 on the row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s a lot of blood .
you want to make a needle just as little sharing you want to share with a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re looking at .
so this is a picture of many studies of all the high animals in the united states , and these are the studies showing that <unk> are effective , quite a lot of it .
so you can see these grim images from africa .
let me say , well , yeah , great <unk> .
ines is a toyota <unk> on the streets . she &apos;s a girl with tails .
it was excruciatingly years old when i did this picture of her photo .
hey , black-eyed susie , whoa .
and a little bit of play plays . here &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> .
we were on the car , in <unk> , texas route , where i spent my early childhood on my early childhood .
and mother sat only in the car .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
and earlier from the <unk> <unk> , they built the &quot; <unk> , &quot; an instrument with <unk> body and <unk> , where the sound comes from .
well , it &apos;s easier than did .
we were not dumb ; we put out a piece of plywood at about five feet a piece of plywood .
when <unk> were <unk> , the thought , why can &apos;t you take the earliest <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; rhythms , and they combine it with the latest technology .
well , i think it works because scientists are being connected by an ethic on a ethic .
it &apos;s significant to point out in space , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of the absolute imagination of space that was god for newtonian god .
and in a relational universe , the only explanation of it was that somehow it was created somehow .
and you get some of things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a relentless filter and you can take it and take it , and think it &apos;s politics .
there &apos;s a fellow tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who contains his work in three different stages .
and just pulsing everything there .
during five months he <unk> himself to experiment with a complete <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so forth .
and philip glass or lou <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , who performed everyone there , they had everyone had their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks , five weeks .
a little bit too <unk> .
and it &apos;s a transition that actually has so much to do with the identity of the living self-portrait with the memory of the dead .
but the <unk> and the <unk> view of wealth shows also the status of the deceased , and as a result of the benefits of the deceased .
if we can broaden our definition of death , embrace life , we could experience death as part of our life , and perhaps death with something more than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ... &quot;
their talk about the lives in the water , and the context , the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we can all naked naked , fewer <unk> and that we can live well .

where are the little ? &quot;
here people have <unk> again .
as you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing , but if you &apos;re going to go into a museum and say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t bother me if i &apos;m going to <unk> your <unk> <unk> , right ? &quot;
and you might think that there &apos;s one of one .
so we &apos;re <unk> and we &apos;ve done a lot of stuff , and we &apos;ve found a lot of small animals .
now , we now know that torosaurus is actually a <unk> <unk> .
looks like it might be even bigger .
we wanted to make a perfect architecture .
so , all the water in the world here is serving , so if you think about the water , moving through water and water , you could also drink the buildings .
the drill was mounted on a wing explosion .
then you come up with this glass tunnel with the <unk> .
before it , and afterwards .
this is a guy from salt lake city city , and this is what it looks like .
&quot; yuck &quot; -- as though they &apos;ve been seduced into a <unk> ward .
it &apos;s not sure that this is what it would be like when the baby wouldn &apos;t have a wife .
by the way , wired magazine .
analyzing the news , they &apos;re talking about when something is missing , as people did in the new york times .
this particular plant filter pool and other volatile chemicals out of the air .
m well , i need to get in the morning when i &apos;m working on trying to figure out what &apos;s going on .
and then -- remember , when <unk> was wearing <unk> on an event on one side of it ?

in fact , in your capital , in your capital , you want some , you know , the vast majority of times , and the life-saving programs like the west will save and save programs like the global fund .
in the opposite , it could save a lot of life .
so if we take this metaphor as a program as a program , then you must think chris anderson is a <unk> object , as well as jim watson , craig venter , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a phone phone like a phone cell phone , and in very abstract language you describe this mobile phone .
this is normal dna , what you do for normal dna .
we heat them off , add something salt , and we heat them up almost till the drill , and cool them , and during the <unk> panels , the short magnetic strands and it turns out there &apos;s a structure .
so , this really works well , and you can build patterns and shape patterns , ok ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna strands , and you &apos;re sitting on a single <unk> device that can attach to other bricks , if you can fit .
we have a very vibrant computer program where small changes -- tiny , single mutations -- individual mutations -- something that created a square dollar of size and making something much bigger .
and the use of computing are <unk> , and to try to understand it , and to get out of it , as feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it in front of us , we had three main <unk> offer , which is a world class <unk> , which is completely disconnected and universal to each other with a medical situation , independently of its resources .
in modern times , where time is a significant good , and the struggle for surviving , is the ordinary <unk> person , and pays the bribe to keep the bribe .
in my last 18 months , as a advocate , a lawyer , in battle against small and large <unk> , the case of india &apos;s biggest business <unk> .
sm : well , the cost cost was less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the last four years , which are all around the world , from new york to small new york here in the corner .
so with a lot of content , we usually do a lot of things to make it easier to make it easier .
so what we do is we use these <unk> to find unique talks , which , in creative fashion , lots of different fields together , like that , which is a lot of our stuff , and like that , which is really creative between <unk> bridges .
no wonder that it &apos;s going to come up with my colleagues , because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of <unk> could be as well in a <unk> as well as in a hospital .
at ted , brilliance is ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
secondly , known as <unk> nature of modern american education , <unk> , step by step .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a wedding community in your community ? &quot;
a way to do that is not to get done more ethic courses .

bill gates talked about the importance of education , and specifically about the model &apos;s model for kipp .
barry schwartz schwartz does a passionate basis of &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to a society who argues that rules often fail , incentivize incentives and practical , everyday wisdom will help our world .

<unk> is a living small city , and to go to the beach , she said , &quot; you need to take a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and so we put in the event .
businesses are making things for households -- we &apos;re -- and we &apos;re providing income , and that &apos;s even better for us to use those societies for more goods and services , and we can use those societies for more goods and services .
the <unk> , <unk> , was under zero in 2008 , just before the crisis .
you can hear the mind the mind of the five-year-old .
and at the same time , the answer is clear because it doesn &apos;t require human nature to change human nature .
we need to actually , indeed , invest in the idea of investing in a meaningful wealth , which is the possibilities for people .
first , it &apos;s never going to take economists , so it might be , so it might have something that you need to add in your tone of your tone .
i painted it immediately on the man .
it went about space and light .
so this photograph was taken when i went out <unk> bay into alaska in alaska to try to burn up management service , to try to burn <unk> in ice .
another aspect is spreading out when it hits water .
and this is actually really <unk> .
and then of course , there was john d.
it was also the national act of act , the clean air act , the clean air act , the clean air act .
they have <unk> <unk> in <unk> , in economy . they &apos;re entrepreneur ; they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
if you look at people who deserve $ <unk> in the years that they have two children , they might have three jobs , and they have to do it .
we need to think about it as <unk> , and you can find more about these politics .
you know , the first person you know .
here she says to be an afghan star of how her friends <unk> her , because she said her friends , and her said she &apos;s leaving her friends around the world for democracy .
last year , when i was here , i was talking about my swim on the north pole .
it feels like someone &apos;s behind you , and you &apos;ve got a hammer all around you with a hammer around your head .
and there we sat down , and we <unk> what went wrong was there on mt . everest .
<unk> about this , talking about this , and gives a hundred percent , because there are only very , very few things that can &apos;t possibly be done when we apply our entire power to this .
this is a <unk> machine . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we reach some kind of <unk> ?
what i &apos;m showing here is that we can create a <unk> filter -- the b -- <unk> from a string of components that followed extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes ultraviolet rays .
and when you saw amy smith , they &apos;re talking about how to connect students with haiti with communities in haiti .
and it may be that we seem to look at all the assumptions of today &apos;s reality , and it &apos;s connected , the number of problems that we have to solve .
we &apos;re becoming increasingly aware that we don &apos;t even need to go into the entire chain .
ok . i also have one .
can we combine it again with natural ecosystems around us , by combining rivers again , using rivers again ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 deaths per conflict of 65,000 deaths per year from 1950s to 2,000 deaths per conflict per year , that &apos;s so terrifying .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want to be the <unk> .
if i don &apos;t have to update one of these two , right ?
the developing countries used using soap and water , vaccination .
and now i have the <unk> on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad . until there &apos;s this big jump forward .
do you see how it grew ? and how hundreds of millions and billions people get out of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they &apos;re buying food for the poor ; they &apos;re <unk> malaria .
and we have to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t make it all out of africa . don &apos;t make a difference from it .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it won &apos;t happen by a reform around it .
and many of you have the term &quot; memes . &quot; the evolution of technology is something that i give a lot of press , which , you know , one of the first things you had , was a little <unk> .
my argument is basically that , well , <unk> , always part of our lives were always part of our lives .
and this is pretty new , and i think it gets worse worse -- this possibility -- because of using developments in the information technology , in <unk> , that as weapons can use as weapons use , like biotechnology or rational .
i &apos;m doing my best , ok .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> &quot; means &quot; he saved the people &apos; people , &quot; which is to say , &quot; which is a pretty sophisticated <unk> .
we have only civil wars in six countries civil wars , which is reporting media only about six countries .
so , how do we put our money into it ?
none of these countries , including africa <unk> nation , has ever since its latest <unk> .
during this development , we became , africans , on the edge of development , take care and policies in our countries in our countries .
the overhead , mostly <unk> billion , costs billion billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now , 14 of these diseases are treatable , two of them even <unk> .
so in the past 10 years , and as a hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of psychology : a science of what life makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them differently , because they build on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to do the same with the other -- three different happy life .
but it turned out there was no trauma trauma .
you don &apos;t look out like <unk> <unk> .
and what they find is that if they do something altruistic , they do something altruistic .
when i was two years ago , i figured out when i was good enough to make someone depressed not depressed , not afraid , that i was going to make him happy .
a polar bear , floating in the arctic , recorded by paul <unk> .
but these so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; occurs when everyone parts sticks together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection comes from .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- thousands of photos took from this .
sometimes you can tell a narrative story in a very focused way .
we want to find solutions as well .
and then kind of all race and jumping .
thank you .
and what &apos;s even more important is because this is a <unk> process that you can only pick in three seconds , and we can establish emily in a period of less than a single afternoon in several different pieces of entertainment and <unk> .
emily &apos;s : image metrics is a pill , <unk> <unk> .
eventually , i got involved in it .
there &apos;s also a bunch of beautiful primates in the reserve .
but i was from the west and i was working in the east .
all these things were consumed by <unk> , killing animals , the forest , etc , and so on .
this is <unk> <unk> , and pan out of gold .
and eventually one day we met with the <unk> .
the elephant seal <unk> and they took the <unk> .
i don &apos;t think anyone can accuse google , because google does the right thing , even if people like al qaeda , they use to connect themselves .
<unk> <unk> : a hero of the congo river
we &apos;ve seen , almost without having it noticed , from a market economy to a solar economy .
you don &apos;t have to pay it off from your budget .
i was going to ask them what happened to these experiments in these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens who share a common life .
they have the united states as a leading nation in 1900 , where the line line toward red .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women are going to come back up into the <unk> revolution .
but electricity was also supporting women in the emancipation of the women .
an astonishing fact in the first half of the 20th century is that in the first half of the 20th century , life expectancy three times as fast as it is in the second half of the 19th century .
that was the kind of paper i knew about 10 years ago , and i received a 2 calculator .
i have a number of people who thought a lot of time between five and 15 , which was my specialty , and that led to a sense of failure .
so , i think if i look at creativity , i think it &apos;s also about extending or the <unk> elements of the relationship that i see between basically everything in life .
this is what tribal fishermen say , because they don &apos;t actually kill any organisms .
and they &apos;re going to memorize it more common .
and i had to find what fit in the history of the story .
how are we going to figure out what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a dish ?
and they have to be in all kinds of ways , including the ones i haven &apos;t seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see it when i &apos;m reading these examples , because i &apos;m really talking about everything you might spend your time doing your time .
now there are magazines about water .
people pay the full paycheck , and the only thing they have in common is they have nothing in common .
the <unk> <unk> , on the middle goals , is the big market .
these guys are the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t need to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t need to be completely uninsured .
so , what you have to do is figure out who cares about who cares .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to send messages in square months later , which was a picture i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
most of the time it tends to turn the cultural heritage in us , and <unk> the past .
my first story for national geographic , which i realized is that if you can build environmental issues in a story about nature , i had devoted to the history of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the oceans .
and because i &apos;m living in love -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to make another positive story about sharks to say about the importance of conservation to sharks .
after i left <unk> , i learned that these habitat will be vital to create a new toolbox .
they were also caught up in <unk> .
but the fish came back and <unk> acres and <unk> <unk> , grew forests surrounded by seaweed in the shallow water .
now , she lives in the clearing of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , and her second son , the side of the second orangutans , is also the <unk> of the second orangutans i have ever saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you look at yields and start measuring what comes out .
so , how do we change this loop ?
and you need bacteria to tie the nitrogen , and you don &apos;t have any that kind of stuff .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so , we can really change the climate .
in <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use justice system to protect your own system .
the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll still show you one more .
<unk> <unk> demonstrates <unk> sculptures , beautiful works , beautiful works in the pattern of apocryphal frames , <unk> waves . in nine minutes he <unk> us with his <unk> art -- at the same time inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has its own design .
twenty-three years later , you would ask us to come and reclaim this idea .
this is italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese spaces , the japanese spaces , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it does not exist or it is something else , a computer program or anything , but not a case part of the science .
people always say that consciousness was hard to define .
you can &apos;t doubt from the existence of your consciousness existence .
it &apos;s a digital computer computer program in the brain and to make conscious mind , we must just find the right program .
we always bring the objectivity and subjectivity subjectivity as a reality of reality and as property of those kinds of microbes .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i &apos;m also meeting people doing what they &apos;re doing , and they couldn &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we &apos;re not teaching american story to the u.k.
teenager don &apos;t wear a <unk> .
perhaps later , not directly .
no , does it not .
i couldn &apos;t make this thing really easy to work , regardless of how often i did .
but we must shift from an industrial model to a <unk> model where every single school could flourish every single school .
so erez and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason for this is that the historic <unk> is obtained by <unk> speed .
so , you went up with a light . she said , &quot; ok , so you &apos;re serious .
they performed a group of students in protest in the streets of protest .
i stood up , i sat down , and i sat down and i &apos;m here -- still <unk> , but there &apos;s still almost paralyzed , but here .
peace direct <unk> <unk> at the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the republic to democracy , &quot; with <unk> practices for <unk> resistance .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you , show you this picture , you &apos;re still going to think that you &apos;re still going to be one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t make a lot . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution i &apos;m going to talk about is the largest human being in this massive <unk> of the earth from mankind , and from that destruction destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t from the counting -- do we call him <unk> , where they kept extending the impact , in the denominator -- we call it <unk> , where they <unk> the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge drilling rate on the market , which has increased our revenues and profits .
we &apos;ve literally won <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
now , frankly , many of us are afraid that actually business is going to work in business , that it is threatened by technology , and possibly <unk> .
and in fact , what do we need to do for us to construct an experience with a mentally mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , every time they come up with us , is to look at our interactions with <unk> and curiosity .
the three sisters <unk> <unk> with her passionate tomato sauce . at tedwomen , they start joining with the jolly <unk> of david <unk> , and then they &apos;re playing a <unk> , <unk> version of david <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the manchester craftsmen <unk> is named after my neighborhood .
he &apos;s doing a pile of money through the process of doing special furniture for the rich people .
we &apos;ve picked up the <unk> &apos;s curriculum of american manhood , which is the harvard of the tropics , and we associate a <unk> for welfare in the middle of the inner city in the middle of the inner city .
we noticed that you have to give them flowers and eat them and food and food and expectations of them , and so you can always cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who traveled from the world who were going to go from public schools , and that &apos;s what they can be able to do with affection and with affection and sunlight and good music and <unk> .
and it has worked pretty well .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the presence , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you should ever choose to sell it , you know that money is used for school . &quot;
this is a room of nancy wilson &apos;s been built , which took her from our school last christmas day .
the brown buildings , which you &apos;ve looked at , and i &apos;m going to tell you where i made my big mistake .
he came up afterwards . he said , &quot; man , this is a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people <unk> .
bill <unk> shares a quiet and staggering story of cathartic by art , music and unusual alliances .
and the idea then comes into the brain kit , the coded by the brain , and the result is a sign that produces a normal <unk> device .
but there was the limiting factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better respond to normal response , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with an unseen <unk> <unk> out of the environment , so we remain healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and doubles , and they &apos;re all involved in creating these molecules , then the number is increasing the number of molecules in the middle of the cell fires .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photo -- a latch of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly adept at what they need to kill with antibiotics is that we kill bacteria bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and they make tasks that they could never make themselves when they were acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a big honor for me to come to this conference .
or the first ones that come into the hall .
but , as we think of the justice , says aristotle , which is what we need to think about , is the actual character of the causal activity and qualities worth it .
what for one reason they would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he assimilated it .
so , aristotle with flutes , <unk> , and the fierce <unk> question of same-sex marriage , same-sex marriage law .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic
a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> <unk> don &apos;t have to tell us what to do with our time .
and i think this is good -- the future chooses to make a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called us , what does this mean for us ?
i would claim that the speed of taxation is going to be enough .
i would like to suggest that nonsense .
we know that there is this threshold , because we don &apos;t get distracted by any <unk> before we reached an old age of old age , and even though the damage since our lives are born in front of us .
so , you have to do your homework to see if this is true .
audience member : hi somewhere . i read somewhere in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of every one on the planet for 10 years .
and not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care about how we make our profit .
she went into the heart of <unk> , and outfitted <unk> on her agenda .
but i can &apos;t even have a <unk> present , which are more than the arguments i have seen from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
and the <unk> is something eerie , and probably you know a bit of the <unk> .
fourteen american die , one day of asthma , triple lots of stuff in the 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
obviously , he obviously had a humor humor .
politicians and <unk> are afraid of trying to market fraud than &quot; <unk> . &quot;
second because we have them eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; do we try to fix it . &quot;
there you find some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough , we &apos;ll go ahead and pay people to every <unk> that they saw .
he might think he would have the baby baby ever born , so he might have a little bit outside of the outside .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
so we want to talk about africa : the next chapter , &quot; and this is it : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful african , beautiful african .
but importantly , they have to be productive in their lives , and sort of productive as productive environment in our countries so that things can be done .
we can combine it all together ?
we were on the side of the fence .
i had to go through the legs of these people , with my sister on my back to try and find a window .
you know , we need to use everything well .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees among them .
now , the question is , how can we benefit from all this good will come from all this good to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> <unk> in nigeria with <unk> .
and with this idea , an artistic creativity is effectively a very speculative product , so i took this case to analyze it , exactly how we can study any other complex neurological political process .
and the method has been applied since the 90s has been applied to dramatically complex operations .
i want to try to thank you for briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , playing games in change .
how do you study rap now ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity happening there that is involved in <unk> .
so , i want to say that , newton and statistics , this is the mathematics of games and <unk> .
this is very <unk> and is not pleasant .
but keep the mind for the entire time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , can use your facial expressions of natural natural use for example to control a avatar or avatar .
so , they &apos;re fighting very fast . and no one a stable grid is not possible , so kids die .
another level of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every road , every village , almost every square meter of madagascar .
in your <unk> , it &apos;s a very cheap blue lasers .
audience : yes !
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve launched all of them all the time , we haven &apos;t seen it yet , <unk> <unk> in midair .
this is a restaurant house house .
and this <unk> that you see here is actually growing in a <unk> system , which was taken from the outside into the environment and turned out there .
so water is a very important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and the earth is still out there .
the idea is not perfected yet .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you would like to hear how air comes out .
and once we sequenced those two genomes , we wondered , if this is the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , then it could even be a smaller genome from there ?
moreover , we realized that once it would have worked , it would have a real chance to have a real chance if we could get the synthetic chromosomes out of it , put it out of bacteria .
so care is <unk> .
the final quote is a quote from robert feynman , &quot; which i can &apos;t even build myself , and i can &apos;t understand it . &quot;
but actually , in the northwest in the northwest , we actually live here in the northwest , in the actual case of the paradise of paradise , the 36 times as &quot; garden , <unk> through <unk> jets . &quot;
but the more you add , the more it seems to be lost .
and these numbers are never seen before .
this is a nest of an envelope colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony which was created by a queen of a second summer .
the <unk> -- this is supposed to show up -- is an interesting group . they &apos;re going to go out early in morning until the first group to go out tomorrow until the first group .
oddly enough , and interestingly , it looks like something like half the ant colonies just did nothing .
the nest nest is just taking out all the <unk> and put them into the nest edge of the nest and put them up there .
however , the foragers don &apos;t choose .
and what we did , we did experiments , which is that the longer one is growing out and , the longer themselves , the simple <unk> on its surface , and so does it smell different ways that they do different tasks .
they peel off the entire earth , except antarctica .
what you see here is that the cost of the world is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual budget cost three trillion dollars .
and we do this for four percent of the world population .
it &apos;s nothing to do with nothing .
i think where we can use natural gas , where we can use natural gas .
and , as i went into the <unk> , natural gas cost nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
there were 500 million wiped out there .
and it never became oil quality , or anything like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million of the wind in the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> , and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is an event . they &apos;re wiping it out of the world .
these are working in manhattan manhattan , where you built the first sketch .
these were in perhaps six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to do the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story , which is not only going to come and had to wait , but had to be the <unk> when they were there , for three times , they had to call someone .
so , sometimes i &apos;m going to use some more clinical language , and perhaps it won &apos;t be so warm about the heart from other conversation about compassion .
and here is the basic idea that <unk> leads to good actions for people who are going to vote for themselves .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or in my family , i have a lot less to the golden rule . ok .
so , you know , the results up there . this is a zero-sum game .
every shape of interdependence , <unk> , force forces , force one , the humanity of the other .
and they &apos;ll tell you , the other people think that america is not respected and they want to dominate them , and they hate america .
most diseases relate with poverty , but in the case of cancer , children , who died from cancer , the kids who died from modest families , mostly from foreign families .
one week died , a child , but nothing changed .
because you simply don &apos;t use those kinds of energy and you apply it , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant dictionary would say that there is a single single oncogene in a single cell cancer cell , and they make these compasses a <unk> .
what does this mean ?
we found some kind of <unk> material called the right extracellular matrix , we put those cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they were <unk> and on the right to see what we &apos;ve produced in culture .
and of course , where do we ask where we now go ?
and so i &apos;d like to conclude with poem by poem .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist who caught in the <unk> ; a young <unk> , whose book is so many of the <unk> quotes , you put it on the shelves ; it &apos;s a brand <unk> <unk> in the new york times in the new york times .
it sounds like a little bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about themselves .
you took four good friends of a person who suffered their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at them ; they were used to look at them , and they were going to be on .
they told what the bath was , or they said , or they said , they were so far away from the hotel .
woman # 2 : all right there . glass , take a picture !
also , you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it &apos;s really opened my eyes , as often as i left from life , social networks , social networks and so on , even though there was actually nowhere really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and everybody then went off , i walked afterwards .
at least for me , because whenever i &apos;m always doing the same thing , i &apos;m going very , very serious . i &apos;m very short .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see myself when i see myself .
are you nervous nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not pretending it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you have <unk> <unk> , you &apos;ll find buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what people want disparate tribal differences or <unk> , but as citizens can everyone equally equally to be equal .
in egypt , of course , i was discovered eventually .
this had been studied in london , in yemen trained , and <unk> in amsterdam on a airplane to attack america .
there is no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that advocate for democratic culture on bottom-up culture .
as an anecdote , we can point that if poverty is the only factor , well , the united family is one of the richest members of rwanda <unk> .
what happened was there was a political coalition that was going on for a political goal , and that was , of course , the leaders .
these tools are actually getting socially interesting when they &apos;re technically boring .
and he <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and then <unk> them .
and because of the social media , chinese students who studied abroad , or businesses , from the rest of the world in china , there were people all over the world .
and then finally attacking the chinese .
we &apos;re always more media in a media media media in media , socially , and it &apos;s ubiquitous and it &apos;s cheap .
but everything in terms of <unk> i &apos;m going to take as well as i did it .
on my fourth night , on everest , a comet exploded over the mountain . <unk> .
this look at the north pacific , the first four feet of the base base base of base camp .
and this is in camp four .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck was breaking , some of the climbers , had collapsed in this storm in the storm , collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so difficult to work up there , i sometimes put syringes right through the clothing .
the climbers were <unk> .
and i can only just figure out how to do it .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into action .
these are rounded , the <unk> .
and the fourth thing that is really important for me is , &quot; ideas where we need to be involved . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the entrepreneurial rise , became entrepreneurs as entrepreneurs , and they have a considerable component to society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy , because they wanted to bring the ideas into account , from the universal <unk> , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing again is again again .
the second is the <unk> that we have , which are so difficult to make standardized jobs , creating standardized businesses in businesses , that women are in the <unk> area .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have a chance of trying to make modern <unk> , so you don &apos;t have the <unk> people when you grow older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and importance for the world .
so , the government decides to even chose to choose .
in fact , even though people don &apos;t like to hear it , it was actually the revolution of the markets who used the <unk> revolution , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they never fear the mass .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and those who are represented .
<unk> .
each one of these tumors would be statistically tracked two years after the vows .
david cameron <unk> 20 million pounds into a social democratic system to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : invest investment in social change
i &apos;m already collaborating . &quot;
why ? are you getting too tired to go to the <unk> ?

europe had to be brought into development production .
and the flow of resources , <unk> <unk> , isn &apos;t everyone , but yet many countries of the bottom billion .

and so , the bottom of the bottom billion is a very tough politics .
a bunch of economists came in and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;re going to try to expose the value . &quot;

he asked me if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so we were experimenting with small <unk> <unk> to create a dry haze , which is shaped by the wind , and by testing themselves , it turns out that it can be shaped by human beings that are interacting with each other .
they were inserting in their <unk> in the grass , saw the shifting pattern of the <unk> alongside people they didn &apos;t know , and shared the <unk> of wonder .
so , i was also paying attention to that , that this is a huge risk for our society .
when peter &apos;s going to moves his arm , one yellow stain that you see there is the unfortunate location of the action in mind .
so if you do this , what will you want to do ?
and to say that those changes can be beyond the death , even a notion of a fact about a fact that can be true or false .
now , let me clarify what i don &apos;t say , i &apos;m not saying science in this room , and i say we &apos;ll have scientific responses to every <unk> moral question .
well , why would this an objective morality <unk> ?
what is the odds , probably , is that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left-hand side , you see resistant <unk> .
we &apos;re living in a world of <unk> technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easy to break things than they put together together .
but then again , we must talk again about well-being in a wider context .
and what is natural enemy , what are the means of the good bugs we talk about ?
it &apos;s a tragedy , not a <unk> processor , but a <unk> occurs , two millimeters long , lean down , lean down , and <unk> <unk> .
and for example , when we expose those great <unk> to example in a <unk> plot , they &apos;re going to go into the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 130 <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides are spent .
third , to increase awareness of the conscious mind .

and the collapse of the soviet union only finds a few decades later , depending on the soviet union , after the soviet union , was the soviet union of the soviet union .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , they &apos;re actually eating insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do those balls in the soup of soup , and it &apos;s anyway meat in it anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per person per year .
so far from now , we &apos;ll decide for one or to five kilograms of yield yield .
we can grow them a little bit at the cost of rainforests , but it will soon give you a limitations .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not quite available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t started yet , right ?
he said , &quot; oh , ma &apos;am , we must put her on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if the system <unk> the system , they do it in a way that society comes from society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the backside , some of the spheres are <unk> , <unk> , and scales to make some measurements . ok ?
right . so , this device gets used .
there &apos;s a quality of exquisite and precision which is just amazing and remarkable and remarkable .
so , the first robots i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s only used to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors , because it &apos;s up there , and it &apos;s up , it &apos;s 150 feet tall , you know about <unk> and <unk> .
for example , in this case , although the one on the left and the right wheel with a single axis is connected , so fast .
welcome to <unk> , the robots , the robots lab from <unk> tech .
but the cool thing is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how it &apos;s done . so this was our first trial , and ... <unk> !
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a radio perspective of imagination isn &apos;t enough .
so , in this way , education is very important .
<unk> , who will be too utilitarian .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good teachers , and there &apos;s only eight percent of the people in the county have about a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a big empty on creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to sit down all the teammates on the tires , then won the team .
but for the last few decades , a lot of money went to shop for prostitutes , entirely .
and they go out and interview the neighbors about what they buy and from where and why , is a task .
in this , it &apos;s literally impossible to produce large geography phenomenon .
i want to urge you to me , my journey of <unk> and exploration .
after four months of rainy , he pulled out , and now he took eight months of dry before .
here &apos;s a few data here .
but that global action is performing in the same dimension to climate change as fossil fuels , perhaps even more than that .
when i learned about those two things , i felt myself very , both of the reasons for personal reasons as well .
it has a very good <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was part of the ronald mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
after the treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of simple <unk> to see how his visual works .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you in the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
and we &apos;re tracking these <unk> drugs , and we hopefully have more results to report more results .
and then , i have these <unk> <unk> , <unk> disabled writers , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i talk about it , i look at what this is like .
but it was in the fall &apos; 95 &apos; 95 and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : well , it &apos;s done aimee in 1996 , and it &apos;s very excited . your family travels singing -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to do anyone who i could , <unk> against who , against what runners , so on by the direction of what i &apos;m going on here ?
i had always won everything , and i thought , &quot; what ? &quot; i thought , what ?
you can be fluffy . just pick it up . &quot;
mc and the designer will be teaming up at ted <unk> and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got a guy who came over and <unk> the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , but it &apos;s almost impossible to solve the actual loss of business , unless we use copyright math .
or for about the extra jobs .
and there &apos;s something about mathematics : mathematics can sometimes look like mathematics -- like in this example -- and sometimes they do not -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we spend about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step three from hand .
when people ask me , is true true ?
but automation in cars allowed these things to separate these things , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re riding today than building a car and learning its manifesto .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to put computers into the exams .
it was in the middle of 2009 , and i had been blind for about a year .
i thought particularly about my dad , who had passed away , was by trying to do a surgical hospital in the brain .
similarly , just through the grasp of the proton chain , the shifting nation of the soil , and the time becomes a sense of where you are and what you &apos;re looking at is where you are and what you &apos;re looking at .
but then , when i went down and went down to broadway , i was being blindfolded in every corner .
if you &apos;re designing a city in the 19th-century sense of the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of the experience , the article said , &quot; i think it &apos;s atrocious . &quot;
and the main characteristics of the most famous ones i knew -- the ten commandments , love thy next , was fertile and <unk> .
they put money for a good purpose , and they build emotional ways of doing it .
it &apos;s not a book that was written , and it &apos;s been written by the sky .
so , that &apos;s actually the key to me , the keys of happiness , to remind me that in the way here , the car is not <unk> , and i didn &apos;t come up with the <unk> .
so that was very inspiring for me .
so if we wanted this book to make any meaning , then we really need to think about it , and with it rings with it .
so we have this incredible progress .
so , the academics who thought that this is <unk> , so we &apos;ve developed applications like this , so we &apos;ve developed <unk> applications like this , which is going on a laser beam <unk> on a laser beam .
alex was working on a little bit , a bit obscure , independent <unk> with the name , &quot; minority report , &quot; for steven libeskind , invited us to develop the interface in the movie .
we &apos;re leading this <unk> operation through because we like yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s pull this apart : i &apos;ll bring it into <unk> .
we as people , as people , are creating things , and we should make sure that our machines are going to help us and build on it .
john , thank you so much from it to reality .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
but there is the point . the creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line , said , &quot; we can &apos;t change this deal .
they &apos;re created from one community of community to each other .
and like all of the good <unk> , you &apos;ll do a jump of 20 years when people think about the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days , so change , and we started to play <unk> .
but india didn &apos;t want to play the <unk> game .
the other was cricket cricket .
was this new india ? it was a different world where you could get player from anywhere else , as long as you get the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve seen all of them in calcutta , but something we hadn &apos;t seen before . <unk> khan brought the audience with a <unk> song , for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
so could you imagine that this day was going to come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve done every one of them to experience an experience richer , and hopefully the game , and hopefully , there will be a lengthy period of time working in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is , because they &apos;ve screwed fast into memory , like often they &apos;ve seen dogs and they &apos;ve seen dogs on the leash .
why all right in the world should anyone play ?
on the other side , if you can visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a big fireplace for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars on a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way up to the other end of the city is worth 100 bucks worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks , but people don &apos;t think so . but people don &apos;t think that way .
well , in large and large , you &apos;re impatient impatient .
watch what happens when we skip <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more . so , you know , what is the answer to the terrorism , i mean , that it &apos;s some sort of mental error ?
there are no weapons .
and so some people look at economists as dumb people .
issue and variation is one of those kind of intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation of intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with what you have in mind .
-- &quot; in fact , in words and in fashion , the same rule / 11 is the same rule in size or too old . &quot;
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; well , perhaps it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first of all , my willingness to expose me to a critical audience without trying to suggest i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to facilitate the poster <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t have understood it yet .
so , in the big and all day , they &apos;ll survive our survival .
jews often have a slight uncomfortable smell .
if the room air , we were able to watch people have more confined attitudes toward gay men .
it &apos;s as though i &apos;m going to talk about what i did in those 20 years in the days .
it feeds my mind and my spirit .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , there &apos;s hollywood director , with his friends , other friends , and they &apos;re talking about what cinema means .
i got sick of food , i got ill .
we don &apos;t need the problems anymore , we don &apos;t need problems !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the notion that we have these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a generation , we have to undergo a whole generation of children that had to undergo so many psychological pain or damage to it .
throughout the book , over an hour , more than an hour sergeant and interactive animations .
what is business doing ?
it had at least what they were able to do , which was always capable of , but also , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
and when i went from college , i worked in southern california , and you look at the spanish <unk> <unk> on the roofs and stuff like that .
rsw : what does its schedule look like ?
the <unk> -- they sent me to mit , and they sent me their technical <unk> to bilbao .
it reminded me of it .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you spend four months with three wishes , the ideas will always be more explicit and living .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my business book , but somehow lacked , it was to thank all the business people who helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are happening .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see suits , the suits , the <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> , and things is remarkable , and this is supposed to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s incredible work , 15,000 workers , i think , five bridges and the sixth are built up here .
on this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computers in the world are recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , as a fifth percent of the advertisements , had a picture of what &apos;s been a point of view .
and wish of three is : <unk> . i was told myself i wanted to do one myself , and i always wanted to work with something .
and it becomes increasingly important that we can figure out how to extract these materials from these extremely complex sources .
the traditional way to separate materials , simply wouldn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way , <unk> <unk> , is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a hybrid <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> , and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes in the same way , again and again .
perhaps we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and figure out whether they commit the same <unk> as we do .
and here &apos;s mayday . you &apos;ll swap one token for food , and you get happy , and you get your food .
you &apos;re looking for a bit impatient for the fact that the market opens .
imagine that i &apos;m going to show each of you 1,000 dollars in the hand -- ten hundred bucks a hundred dollar notes .
you can either have an unfortunate loss of losing -- so , i throw a coin out of it , and you &apos;re going to lose a coin , and you &apos;re going to lose a lot of losing .
so , if we made in our little <unk> same scenarios , they would generate the same things as people do ?
the person on the left is a safe losing .
perhaps , it &apos;s not just people at the last level of development that they make dumb errors .
and this is the catch .
but when we think of wood buildings , usually four stories are uploaded .
we have to go less with concrete and steel and we need to build up higher spaces .
that &apos;s as much as if we had 900 cars less on the streets of a year .
<unk> curtains my window .
and perhaps , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they got up to the <unk> of justice , and the citizens of these networks are working together to help each other .
<unk> , the largest and oldest bench in russia , largely in the property of the russian government , used now to produce employees and citizens into the development of innovation .
we heard from the ted talk about the people who hacked their plants with arduino , and <unk> is working on the whole world , young people to create websites and turn them on .
and so i started thinking that the mama eternal mother always asks : &quot; are everyone there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to transferring a message , and everyone was reading in their own language , which was a version of the golden rule , which is a version of the golden rule , &quot; which you don &apos;t want you to do . &quot;

that &apos;s my story , shared in form of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , my lunch , i &apos;m a foundation of a foundation i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a little bit more complicated , called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent of it .
and we solve this job by a death penalty problem by a death penalty problem .
and even when it &apos;s happening , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
and santa knows if you were <unk> or wrong . isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
but , julie , you went so ready for school . you were so willing . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiling , in the sense , and they said , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
perhaps your larger ability to cooperate and adapt to ?
i think this movie shows the toughest look at the modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to create a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it takes a fundamental piece of effort , and that is how many resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and <unk> of climate change in the world .
we did a project in front of a number of years ago . a big program , which was called : the <unk> -- with many , many people -- a lot of experts were involved -- it was based on evidence -- a thicker <unk> .
one group you ask for yourself to spend on yourself and the other group is to spend it on other people .
when you went from the first building to second , all of a man passed through a man who went cranked and <unk> , and <unk> help . the question is , did you mind and helped them ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a beautiful book called &quot; about , &quot; which is called the hidden life <unk> things .
now , there &apos;s been four decades ahead -- i &apos;ve been practicing with the best in this field , which has worked young , old teaching , created , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a rich web of art , successes and <unk> .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion , my real life .
so i was dancing between <unk> and <unk> and urged him to fit in my <unk> .
well , it was basically frustration .
it was like it was then .
he put them together , combine them to combine those things , and then he converted them into that software , from which i think they had invented his son , and he performed this wonderful presentation .
in these boxes , there &apos;s little cardboard boxes , small boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , you make a beautiful website . how could i say you &apos;re not going to make a beautiful website ?
now , you &apos;re asking the linked data that you now have put together , 32 hits from each one of these traits , and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what linked data is about .
this is going to happen every year two million children will die less than year last year than 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to go to <unk> and give feedback to make sure that the promises really deliver results ?
you just show one of the numbers here , the 5,000 -- is this number ?
my brothers started to draw me from drawing and painting .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been fascinated to explore in this area .
how many of you have a cow about walking down the road from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s only that we have people to be trained as people to seize reality . and that makes sense .
and they said , &quot; well , ok .
can &apos;t you make nothing out of nothing , you &apos;re yet artist ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because when we watch someone walk through it , we see the footprint .
what percent of those have turned foreign <unk> ?
obviously , he &apos;s sitting at the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the <unk> is actually going to be beautifully designed here , because -- if you think about it , i think about economists , i think today about economists , assumption that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re becoming something technical now .
think about your toyota .
you can &apos;t <unk> against it , so you accept it , and you find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to be true .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
pizza yourself , when they have famine famine .
there are millions of different kinds of <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activity , they &apos;re gonna turn out into baseball .
and it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t bear the <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s like , &quot; how much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in terms of u.k. societies , people have patrons of <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> at home .
and it really became a very strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more <unk> than women ? &quot;
at any time on these were planning , the women were so educated , so interesting , as interesting as this .
she &apos;s 23 she took her her since she was 13 .
and i started to wonder why you kind of fall in love with one person in love with another one .
they &apos;re going to pass as long as the human race is on what shakespeare is called &quot; this <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
perhaps , perhaps we should ask if it might be that resistance is the cause of antibiotics and drug diseases -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too utilitarian .
peter <unk> : what if our beliefs about diabetes would be wrong ?
my great grandfather , henry ford , believed that it was the goal of ford motor company to improve people &apos;s lives and make cars affordable .
and the good news is that we have the great problems today with cars and environmental issues -- not just ford , but all of it , as an industrial .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me are the possibilities that we will when our cars begin to communicate with each other .
we need an infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
this is a minute <unk> .
i think , now my mother , i think , is kind of a kind of incubation .
and the nurses need to enter data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s essential . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on here ?
also for us , it was great , because we won a lot of awards .
i got infected when i was 17 years old , as a graduate student , i met adult who believed in my ideas , <unk> , and many <unk> <unk> with me packed .
now , it went only about the children . we don &apos;t <unk> .
basically , we gave the children a simple task .
for our auction , we have a few wonderful images for them , for a really good reason , the money that they give us , is used to buy aids .
however , what i &apos;d never said , and what i &apos;d like to make sure is that fierce is cool .
in a way in which elegant or <unk> , the product here , we have <unk> <unk> , which is a different type of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of experience -- inspired by the incredible kind of experience .
so if you think about the change in our society , <unk> from the country in the city , taken 200 years , the same process in 20 years has the same process in 20 years .
it saw changes despite even though those were still unknown .
so , for example , we would put models under a virtual sky .
i consider a reduction in size from 94 percent to pretty clean .
and what we do in this growing world is something <unk> , especially in a couple of places i &apos;m talking about -- china , for the next 10 years , will build 400 new united states in the next 10 years .
and this is the emphasis of the huaorani talk -- there &apos;s no grid in the positive senses , which is healthy , and our well-being , no adequate .
in contrast for the first office , i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office building , which is the <unk> <unk> .
you see behind them the <unk> building , which became a legend later on the modern <unk> .
i think what you see here is quite amazing -- how much light in the sky sky and never reaches the ground .
this is not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to be bothered anymore .
if we were announcing , as a number of weeks ago , a war in a third of india is called about 200 <unk> , which is called <unk> , he &apos;s got the issue on it .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i went from office to home , i might look at a <unk> , or i thought , in the sense , i might be like a <unk> , life is wonderful .
<unk> : but what &apos;s it going to use ? what is it used for ?
to do what to do ? to break stones , to dig .
this is the only place where they can express creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice in standards and standards .
and this is what sheikh <unk> <unk> has done .
i needed to be my favorite .
<unk> <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , is only 50 inches .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
this is <unk> billion people .
or <unk> . it &apos;s just fun and people like to do it fun and fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew that it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology of what gravity is about and how the technology can be used .
automobiles are not designed to go side side ; there &apos;s been wonderful <unk> to drive them between cities , but think about it : we &apos;ve got all these problems in terms of scale and speed .
so if we put this box up here in a few years , we might have a solution to the transportation , electricity , and communications , and perhaps water , and perhaps water in a sustainable packages , 60 kilograms ?
and implicitly , and what &apos;s recognized is that the people who are dying there are somehow involved in the drug drug , which do we take from the fact that they either have either tortured or professional <unk> or even both criteria .
los zetas , as a result of a ruler of psychopaths , puts fear and horror in cities and businesses , and that &apos;s true too much .
so , in mexico and the usa , now , has grown into a truly international organization that allowed partnerships to deal with the production and worldwide partnerships in the global economy .
but part of it , a monthly story of being commentary -- you &apos;re living in the future , and we have a long term .
and after they fall under a critical price , they drop , if you &apos;re successful , about a mass of mass destruction , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re very , very , very cheaply , and look at the interesting impact . if they &apos;re cheaper , they &apos;re losing the tags , the brand <unk> , and so , <unk> and the <unk> , they &apos;re going to win .
if you look here , linux in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open access &quot; is really , you know , the gift of the silicon corporation of the world .
because of some of the technology we talked about .
patient capital is working in between and trying to grab the best from two .
it had to be very cheap for the second to be very inexpensive .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers of the world had access to a technology that allowed him to change his life .
and yet , these are the qualities that these men and women have been honored by all sorts of generations .
they remember , during the <unk> photographer <unk> <unk> in his blog about cyclone <unk> and <unk> him , and that was just possible for the blogs to use blogs .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin playing play and told me i can do it too .
i wrote that post , and i took this off because of einstein &apos;s now .
and you see those points .
these little things .
and maybe i need to get <unk> because i &apos;m running out of it when i &apos;m talking about it .
it has been sustainable because of our generation , except from our generation .
we need to use this paradigm instant to get a better understanding of how the oceans works .
we have studied these fish carefully , but first we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s only half the size of the greatest tuna we have ever performed .
they come together . this could be sex under us . and there &apos;s it .
you can chop a ridiculous -- it &apos;s <unk> like a seal -- and a white shark is going to go out there , get a <unk> creature that &apos;s going to get hotter at our 16 foot .
and then these animals give us an encore pillar by helping us .
and the white shark shark shark shark shark shark shark shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the records of my <unk> were so precise .
they said , &quot; aside from what we &apos;ve talked about , are you among groups who want to hurt the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
now , if you look at my <unk> now , i can see that i was there , and i know that i was on the ninth of may <unk> <unk> in the pockets of <unk> <unk> .
so , for all moments , i &apos;m touching a <unk> on my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you like to say what you do and where you are ?
now it &apos;s normal .
now , look at the state of paris , to see how incredibly quick growth is that growth is growing .
i &apos;ve looked at thousands of such examples , and trust , and efficiency is always the absence of elements .
how do we ask about how trust is built by face ?
i was kind of a spirit in the system .
this side gets confused by a day , and eighty percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and so , you see it in relation to the degree of inequality i showed you , i &apos;m going to go back and over again .
so , first of all , the rich , developed countries , and then in a second sketch , even with the 50 american states -- cut the same question , cutting the more unequal states at all those scales .
and with devastating implications , what we &apos;re dealing with is the benefits of the talents of public health .
and in our analysis of the american states , we find the same contrast .
and the socially <unk> doctrines are taking out , and the fear of these mutual judgments .
or for example , why violence in more unequal societies is more widespread more widespread in more societies , because people are sensitive to become <unk> agents .
takes more than three million gallons per year or a new knee , or a <unk> .
they remember like kamal before the <unk> .
if you put it under shorts or one sari or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that they &apos;re carrying a prosthesis , and that in societies , with a social stigma , people are very sensitive to people with a pro-social campaign , people are very sensitive .
so thank you very much .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i even bought the <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a little bit of a piece of paper that says , &quot; don &apos;t you use those diamond tools to add juice into juice .
so these are the results one up to 20th to 20th , &quot; google just as a lot &quot; &quot; o &quot; by the way there are pages .
the serious fear is <unk> .
but if you were always in that condition , it would never be done , because you would never be done , because you would say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do , is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the theme park were rusty , and it would fall apart , they wouldn &apos;t be going to let it go .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- so you wouldn &apos;t <unk> the results .
now , i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization , and a series of experiments that i have led to the idea of what an alternative education might look like .
and one day later , <unk> 70 children on the internet .
so , i could even actually choose to cover a camel , which is partially represented throughout the world .
what you see , obviously , there is a child that is operating on the computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , cells , organisms , societies , societies , societies , other societies .
and it &apos;s about the <unk> of idealism in this whole hindquarters .
i bought with a nice suit , wearing shoes with <unk> , and i was collaborating with this remarkable creativity that i had led to <unk> .
but in 2002 when my tour went to finish , i decided i &apos;d not waited the job that was waiting for me in london .
i felt something had been destroyed .
and i went through these , and i went through these meetings .
and i traveled in kosovo and <unk> the government .
well , as a diplomat , it &apos;s part of a trend worldwide , which comes out , obviously , and determine that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that these people who are actually affected , not <unk> .
this is the 21st-century politics of the 21st century , and in some sense , as celebratory diplomat these laws , these change that we face with all of us .
&quot; hey , could you even be more explicit ? &quot;
because when we go back to <unk> , they understood through this practice that a very simple mistake can say , what you don &apos;t , or tell us about how to do something .
we feel awe , compassion .
let &apos;s go here .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s there was the bellwether show called &quot; the <unk> , &quot; which 1973 in 1973 in the top 10 , followed by &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; three angels for charlie . &quot;
i can choose them from the island .
and i &apos;m looking forward to talk about having to talk about them , i come in and say , &quot; can someone tell me the textbook textbook and why it is so cool ? &quot;
next is producing this <unk> stuff , which is <unk> <unk> .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , <unk> education will always be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but then we have a lot of work in front of us , and if someone is involved in science , i &apos;m going to ask you to do with me .
we climb up the stairs and we see a state changed consciousness .
so many books about warfare are doing the same thing , which is that there is nothing very appealing about it as a war .
durkheim believed that everything was united , what it takes us , a ridiculous notion of sacredness .
and he said , &quot; <unk> and <unk> people aren &apos;t going together , and without <unk> , can &apos;t be moves . &quot;
he uses the other .
once they were everyone in the same tribe , they were able to keep the benefits of cooperation .
it &apos;s about connecting to others , to reclaim ethical ideas .
jh : thanks very much .
and i realized that <unk> is not just going to need to be inside .
and right next to the garage he put his own <unk> , where he tagged himself in his <unk> , which is another important role in <unk> .
everything &apos;s always been simpler in design , and here &apos;s this platform , and , my god , i &apos;ve just photographed , &apos; my god , i photographed it .
so , the end of <unk> is printed now , right now .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; it &apos;s a different word for quotes .
so this is actually an experiment for a customer , <unk> , where we took a sequence of six photographs and trying to bring people on the printed medium into the internet .
they felt they didn &apos;t like people they liked .
a article about brian <unk> -- a really boring article -- so i set up all the articles on <unk> .
somebody said to me today , there were these things called &quot; folder , &quot; but i don &apos;t know what that is .
so , most of the jobs is pretty high .
before it , obviously , obviously , not technology , but obviously .
this is not the other planet . these are things that are hidden on our planet .
and i finally come back to those <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> by stephen jay &apos;s theory of <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard about tribal flares , <unk> degrees .
and i think this is really important . because if you look at mozart in front of the invention of the technology -- what it would be for a loss of society .
octopus <unk> me for the first time i was very young .
and he reaches again , takes a arm full of gravel , let him go out ... &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! &quot;
but the point is : we were there for a month , and i wanted to get used to see the animals so that we could see her behaviors without disturbing them .
and if you go further down to the bottom , the lovely blue fish , which you left them to begin with , has always been <unk> and <unk> .
but there &apos;s no sun at the bottom , there &apos;s no photosynthesis . it &apos;s down there , it &apos;s down there , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
but fortunately i have seen the exact opposite .
everybody talking about each other , and then there &apos;s no epidemiology on the map on a map , then it &apos;s a network that we &apos;ve created .
she was a stay-at-home mom , and she and i did not go and <unk> like small girls , and she didn &apos;t buy me in a pink clothes , but knew .
my parents took a cd , and my sister was arrested .
towns are the <unk> of civilization .
is edinburgh a horse ?
we think our entire economy is going to be so , shown in the left-hand left , <unk> .
the heartbeat rate , they have lasted longer , <unk> from <unk> and nutrients from the membranes , slowly slowly , etc . , etc .
but the most important thing is , the <unk> , the analog to the <unk> , is bigger than one is -- it &apos;s kind of like one -- kind of like that .
they grow rapidly and stop , part of our <unk> .
look more like a <unk> .
children in the 12th classroom are less enthusiastic about political systems .
he had to talk to a high school in a high school .
my students made these <unk> as a result of a assignment that we had asked us about the oil spill of the year .
this is my favorite day because it &apos;s taken on tuesday when i first got to choose the students &apos; choice .
and with this , it &apos;s equivalently ticklish .
actually , you could -- -- we &apos;re not going to go into that .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;m going to show you 15 million bucks .
you see the stem cells coming out again .
many of these patients are getting severe .
the european union , the same .
and even though i have no patents , as i realized , they &apos;re going to meet some of my inventions today .
you know what that means .
and they &apos;ve done all those progress in so short time . they &apos;re all so young .
thank you all .
in the school -- in fact , i did an organization which does something like this , you know , like this , you know , you would like it , you would like it , you would like it , you would like it .
she was also very shy , but she was so <unk> .
my daughter -- my daughter , she wrote , she said , &quot; start your talk always with humor . &quot;
i &apos;m a lesbian . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and then finally , i finally got a phone call that i finally got to talk about <unk> <unk> .
and i thought , if i could write books in which this world was tiny and linked , maybe perhaps human beings on the problems that affect us all , and perhaps , perhaps , to improve the world .
and john said , &quot; bet on good people doing good . &quot;

this is in <unk> houses .
they put them on a very special diet , and they treated with big care .
his app was first <unk> when he won the <unk> prize .
but there was a lot of debates about how to get asked this problem .
so what we have is the situation in the world today where there is increasingly more countries among citizens between citizens and government reports from the internet , which is ruled by largely private services .
rebecca <unk> : let &apos;s bring back to the internet !

it &apos;s been waited since 1960 , as <unk> hardy , a <unk> , said , &quot; i think our ancestors lived for a long time in the water . &quot;
but as an absolute connection , it only works in one direction .
and then even the fact that we can be rotating .
for example , professor <unk> . he understood it .
so if it &apos;s going to happen , and if it &apos;s going to happen , who is going to come up with it ?
first : i want to make as <unk> as possible .
yeah , i was hanging yesterday with a bunch of <unk> .
you see , somehow , in the lives of other people , i have a lot of inspiration from the user &apos;s life .

<unk> and <unk> roche frank gives a very precise <unk> and tell us about what he wants to hang with people with little , <unk> people , with small , <unk> <unk> and interact .
and the answer is quite peculiar .
so , stage four : tell people , &quot; if nobody gives you the basis of information , i offer my help . &quot;
and every time i talk about what i &apos;m going to do , at least briefly the cause , why body matters .
so this particular device called the <unk> device .
they &apos;re shrinking and melting simultaneously -- and some of them vanished .
that wouldn &apos;t be a big problem , because if we were in <unk> , we would put our arguments , everything would be built into our arguments , everything would be necessary , and find a way to find them <unk> .
this is data from the <unk> of congress , you show the <unk> prediction of what &apos;s going to happen if the present conditions and trends continue on .
the rocks is sacred , and when people wrap something together , they unite each other , unite them , they can trust each other , they &apos;ll be one .

for many reasons , the decades after the second world war has been a protracted situation .
there we stand as a country .
we will be a nation with two classrooms .
this is truly a social disaster , and the liberals are very worried about it .
but they don &apos;t exist yet . so i have to make them .
they &apos;ve been racing since time in architecture .
you see , you can see that the protocells actually move from the light away from the light bulb and into the dark <unk> .
i have been able to shut myself down almost for the last three decades , and i think i &apos;m probably proud of it .
so instead , i &apos;m a believer in law , psychology and psychiatry at universities , and i have a lot of good friends at the universities of law , i have a lot of good friends and a beloved husband , who is here today .
and i quote from my writings : &quot; i had <unk> myself with my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we wanted to work together on one assignments .

i don &apos;t like to think of a problem without the acknowledge , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m trying to highlight here , like &quot; mad rag &quot; and movies like &quot; <unk> &quot; and movies like &quot; <unk> , &quot; whose female characters and <unk> are complex and <unk> .
his name is matthieu ricard ricard matthieu ricard . his name is matthieu ricard .
i know there &apos;s other companies in the world with empathy , but google is the environment that i know , because i &apos;m about 10 years from now , so i &apos;m going to use google as well .
so , it turns out google is a business of compassion , because googlers find that compassion is fun .
there you come at the morning work in the morning , and you have three teams who come from <unk> skies to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope compassion also will be also fun for them as a profit .
but one day , the perfect case . it was a <unk> street sitting in front of your house .
i went to one of the most <unk> , which was the training of <unk> and <unk> , which is what the normal response does in contrast to the <unk> .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , that &apos;s wonderful , but it &apos;s highly <unk> .
in the same <unk> you experience , when you sit down in the new york subway , and you reads this <unk> and a small feeling .
different parts of the world have a cult <unk> for different things .
and at the same time , the magnificent work of <unk> <unk> , who popularized these beautiful <unk> and <unk> out of <unk> .
but the objects <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> to this kind of water company , and it was really quite widely distributed .
even this chair they &apos;re opening and then they &apos;re stuck with it , so this is the beautiful series of objects that are seen as design from <unk> to me in barcelona .
what credentials does now have to do with it ?
instead , they designed a very interesting approach to my education , which is , namely , that they were going to send me on a school they hardly capable of .
my last story , and i have to get a little bit closer now .
and he died when he was on the tour to get him into the hospital .
<unk> is a way to do that .
just jump ahead .
and we need africans to begin to question our leading politicians critically .
my cousin couldn &apos;t afford to do that school fees , and she &apos;s very smart .
and if you don &apos;t take it , it &apos;s true with those things .
in many years , the country was divided between politics and religion .
so our political problems too .
<unk> and future leaders have been shaped .
he helped in haiti with a born .
it &apos;s the heart of health care .
i &apos;m going to sell this simple to every hospital in the world .
now , when i got this , i was -- push the <unk> -- entirely except myself , you know ?
now , in a few weeks , a big girl will be a big girl .
and as you can see , the life expectancy was short .
life expectancy in <unk> .
this is the absolutely best technology for this region : <unk> .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you &apos;ve got to share with the world .
the generation y seems like <unk> .
100 thousand people flock together into nonviolent march and an idiot , or an <unk> , and guess you &apos;ll see who caught up from the cameras , and this guy &apos;s going to be captured by the cameras . this one guy .
and it &apos;s also about humor humor humor , humor , such as a strong force that can flip the game . it was also in poland a very big role .
well , the <unk> , what is going on in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw my talk in live <unk> .
i said , &quot; if 500 to 1,000 or 2000 , my life is dead . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more than that .
and i see them .
and everybody went out in round and said , &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know her father never had in <unk> , he was singing in singing .
the other thing you know about shame , it &apos;s absolutely organized by the sex organized .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
we want to be with them and to follow them .
and now , when we walk up and <unk> ...
if i had an ant in the rice , i couldn &apos;t see that .
this really helped us develop a very ethical and very strong organization , and a system that helped us .
we have a very simple camera camera in a <unk> newspaper , and we can do this kind of <unk> by a physician in every patient for every patient .
our revenues has dropped out faster , which gives us a normal cost of profit , and yet we &apos;re treating lots of people for free .
that &apos;s a difficult job .
for example , we can add digital content with physical sources .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make cell computing more intuitive ?
it was , as you couldn &apos;t seen me as though i was invisible .
and no one had ever heard before , or seen , and this sort of thing , is the creation in new ways of vision , depending and knowing , because now you have this idea in your mind in your mind right now in your mind .
in <unk> , the hole is <unk> , at least temporary , but not without an enormous cost of desire .
don &apos;t worry about that .
and it &apos;s also the history of modern capitalism , because it was wealth of this country , which displaced our limbic system system , which is a system that allows us to survive with no existing growth of territory .
the oil is not liquid .
now you might have noticed more headlines like this .
great show . man , that was good !
bf : ... anyway , in the left .
dh : all right , please stand here ...
rw : can i keep him ?
dh : do it just <unk> , say ?

bf : from six to seven . dh : that &apos;s world war . bf : all right ? dh : for us .
it &apos;s less known as the two , because he had this idea of building mechanical <unk> and never built one .
but if you saw something that is very , very similar .

13 years after i &apos;m sitting in a wheelchair , i have done more in life in the wheelchair than i did outside of him .
by generations , we have raised our children as well as millions of other species that live with us .
but it &apos;s not a regular movie .
but if i took a base on every pixels on every pixels on every pixels on every pixels on this screen , we would need 3,000 aircraft to look at the genome to look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he took the genomes of his children .
it was because there would be someone in the audience who wants to shut everyone wants to stop .
so , imagine in 2016 , the leading lexicographer isn &apos;t just entirely about <unk> <unk> , but you &apos;re also allowed to share with your personal genome , but also your personal genome .
and so i &apos;m going to ask them all , <unk> and to affect the genomic revolution that happens around them .
and we &apos;ve got a <unk> , powered <unk> <unk> with a special <unk> , which is smashed up inside of the mountain and moves through the edges of the hip on the <unk> of the hip .
hopefully will allow us to be able to allow us to see the technology growing more of these survivors .
on the twig , what the sample probe was put on a wall of the gas release , and <unk> is dies .
so it &apos;s exciting . it can calculate the co2 from the earlier stages , so we &apos;ll be able to figure out some new particles , so we &apos;ll begin to detect some new particles .
the most famous charge is the electric charge .
they tell us what changes are allowed .
but that really works unified theory .
many of them think about the most beautiful structure in the mathematics .

the pattern of points that i showed you , actually describe symmetries of this <unk> stain , that bends , moves and on space-time on space-time .
and we also have heard from the history of the history , from the bloodline of humanity through genetic engineering .
we find many , many examples of compassion , many examples of compassion , before love and altruism .
most of the most important , i think , is working with small groups of women trying to give them the opportunity for self-reflection .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the solution to all the problems we have on the planet , in terms of the environment and in social , and it &apos;s a message of hope .
and <unk> <unk> , and what young people hear about other people hearing better from other people than adults .
that change , change change . change is necessary when we worry about the future .
working with plastic , about the first eight years , about the first eight years , i started breaking down some of my pieces and break into smaller <unk> .
recycling . everyone cuts about his book about <unk> ecology with the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m going to show our youngest and successful , which is the development in the development of the development .
the author of book is juan , our <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s actually created by amazon brilliantly by amazon .

by 15 years old , i lost a child , a second when i was 16 .
i know what it means , and what a crime is , if a crime is going to be a person , a person should be disciplined and disciplined . &quot;
but what if that isn &apos;t that ?
but after a few <unk> prototypes , i actually thought of myself , but eventually it came out here , the <unk> .
adding that . please .
ok . the <unk> is used by thousands of people worldwide .
or we could use one of these things .
mao tse <unk> described as the european civil wars , and it &apos;s probably a more accurate description .
by the way , my urging , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not possible by the alternative fields .
they &apos;re beginning to see the <unk> of a <unk> world .
but this is no longer the case .
the behavioral sequences of nations , well , we used always .
but now one last thing .
but if you ask the most fundamental questions today , like the optimal formula for a long life , he probably wouldn &apos;t like this .
it reminds me of my college at my college .
and research shows that these years largely would be free from chronic diseases , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
currently we are at half .

you just have your eyes to get through there .
i mean it &apos;s seen that it was seen .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve calculated the driver of carbon models .
and i said , &quot; i can &apos;t get them there , but i can bring them into zero-g , in zero gs .
we had four main nurses and two nurses in the airplane .
and actually , you can now show some images because i don &apos;t want to see myself on the screen .
no life , from the smallest life to us all of us here , would be allowed to be able to do those little micro-machines .
i went <unk> on <unk> . i used to eat regular food . i used to eat regular food .
i hadn &apos;t changed my way . my iq wasn &apos;t down .
i was a writer .
basically , no one would accept family planning if their child doesn &apos;t survive .
and then , we decided , why not use religion , because on the philippines , the catholic church was quite strong , and <unk> were buddhists .
we performed , 1975 our first <unk> , and the women who were organized , they said , &quot; we want to borrow family planning to help women practice family planning .

but you can see the spikes clearly recognize .
the challenge for the most fundamental players is , if you think the other is fair , is fair or commandments , so they think only one one or two dollars to do .
now i &apos;m imagining you a few related things .
we can try it . maybe we &apos;ll do it .
so what have we learned today ?
it takes about 10 calories to make a food food that we consume in the west .
so , how do you get a city like this ?
and in the beginning of the city , in <unk> , they &apos;re offering to name for slippers , which is why it &apos;s called <unk> .
and at that point , our relationship is entirely changing with food as well as the cities .
the word used thomas moore &apos;s applied moore .
<unk> pile of <unk> .
we need to understand that the world is what we eat .

and i couldn &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first image of the probe of the surface , which was what we saw .
so , here we see a movie of titan <unk> , which is the dunes of this dunes , and these dunes are 100 meters up there , have a distance from a few kilometers thick , and then <unk> and miles and miles .
until now , the planet is still the only planet , where we know it lacks life .
they &apos;d lost 40 percent of their country , and they would have been around , so they wouldn &apos;t have free access to the rest of the west bank .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we organized a demo .
it took them only four days .
and like the rest of the brain , he &apos;s from neurons .
in the hippocampus of the hippocampus , you actually find cells that will respond to the hippocampus in the hippocampus , which is exactly rigid to boundary or edges in a particular way and towards the rat , if you explores around the environment .
and this would be represented by the <unk> of the <unk> .
he was not the only man who suffered from a america with no <unk> , and he was certainly not the only grand gentleman of his time .
and why would someone care about that ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and analytical thoughts and wisdom .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so we &apos;re looking at them .
and if you talk about what they believe , they will be dressed , believe what they think they believe .
the reason why people bought an iphone in the first six hours would buy in the line of six hours in the line , your worldview , and her will see everybody them . they were the first .

and this report on president <unk> desk when i was two years old , in 1965 .
but , you know , you &apos;ve got sunlight , which is hitting on particles , and it &apos;s <unk> heating .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
so there we go beyond this , and further from the current climate .
not just how we make it better , but what are the risks and side effects ?
here you see a fish with shining flashing , <unk> eyes .
real incredible . here &apos;s two males here .
and so i came up with her friendly invitation just two days ago from the himalayas .
but if you look at the literature in east and west , they will find incredibly different definitions of happiness .
well-being is a deeper sense of serenity and fulfillment , one condition that actually <unk> all the states <unk> and <unk> them and every joy and sorrow that allows us to zoom in .
from experience we know that we can be in something called &quot; paradise paradise , &quot; and inside are completely unhappy .
so the mirrors that , but the mirrors will not allow the mirrors from it , modified by those images .
whenever you do it again , your propensity for your outrage is to drop your mind once again , because you break it down .
of course , we do the training with objects .
we &apos;re ready , 15 years for our education education .
it &apos;s really a <unk> for us .
it &apos;s a <unk> place . it &apos;s done well .

they would pay 10,000 dollars in orbit .
it says you &apos;re going to move 10,000 feet per second when you &apos;re actually going to go back to gas station .
with the right support , that can be done in seven years .
i guess you &apos;re not going to get me from the stages , because you &apos;re asking the question .
